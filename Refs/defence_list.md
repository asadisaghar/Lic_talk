                               Abstract
A study of the hidden matter concentrated around massive galaxies used 
data collected from the companions of our galaxy and of three external 
spiral galaxies. A graph of the joint distribution of the companions of 
all four galaxies showed a line of segregation between regions populated 
by elliptical and non-elliptical companions. The segregation of 
companion galaxies was connected to the presence or absence of 
interstellar gas in the companion. It was shown that the segregation 
mechanism does not reduce the tidal interaction which is too weak to 
produce radial effects. The observations made suggest that intergalactic 
gas is not randomly distributed between galaxies but is concentrated 
around massive galaxies, forming their coronas.

                               Abstract
The hierarchical cold dark matter (CDM) model for structure formation is 
a well defined and testable model. Direct detection is the best 
technique for confirming the model yet predictions for the energy and 
density distribution of particles on earth remain inadequate. Axially 
symmetric collapse of collisionless dark matter can leave observable 
caustic rings in phase space and this model is frequently used to make 
experimental predictions (Sikivie 1999). Such cold collapses inevitably 
suffer from radial orbit instabilities that produce unrealistic bar-like 
halos. Moreover, this model bears no relation to the hierarchical growth 
of CDM galactic halos which form via a complicated sequence of mergers 
and violent relaxation. This process destroys any symmetry and phase 
wraps existing caustics on a scale comparable to the first objects to 
collapse. Since axions can cluster on microscopic scales and free 
streaming of neutralinos only erases structure smaller than \sim 100 
(GeV/m_{CDM}) A.U., the dynamical effects of caustics in the Galactic 
halo are expected to be negligible.

                               Abstract
I give a review of catalogues of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and 
superclusters - sources of information to study the large-scale 
structure of the Universe. Thereafter I shall discuss the power spectrum 
of density perturbations, and the correlation function - principal 
description functions which characterize the large-scale structure. I 
shall pay special attention to the geometric interpretation of these 
functions, i.e. to the way in which the various properties of the 
distribution of galaxies in systems and systems themselves are reflected 
in these functions. Finally, I discuss cosmological parameters which 
characterize general properties of the Universe - the Hubble constant, 
densities of various populations of the Universe, and parameters of the 
power spectrum of galaxies and matter.

                               Abstract
We determine the distance to 38 clusters of galaxies in the redshift 
range 0.14<=z<=0.89 using X-ray data from Chandra and 
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) data from the Owens Valley Radio 
Observatory and the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association 
interferometric arrays. The cluster plasma and dark matter distributions 
are analyzed using a hydrostatic equilibrium model that accounts for 
radial variations in density, temperature, and abundance, and the 
statistical and systematic errors of this method are quantified. The 
analysis is performed via a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique that 
provides simultaneous estimation of all model parameters. We measure a 
Hubble constant of 
H<SUB>0</SUB>=76.9<SUP>+3.9</SUP><SUB>-3.4</SUB><SUP>+10.0</SUP><SUB>-8.0</SUB> 
km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> (statistical followed by systematic 
uncertainty at 68% confidence) for an Ω<SUB>M</SUB>=0.3, 
Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB>=0.7 cosmology. We also analyze the data using 
an isothermal β-model that does not invoke the hydrostatic 
equilibrium assumption and find 
H<SUB>0</SUB>=73.7<SUP>+4.6</SUP><SUB>-3.8</SUB><SUP>+9.5</SUP><SUB>-7.6</SUB> 
km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> to avoid effects from cool cores in 
clusters, we repeated this analysis excluding the central 100 kpc from 
the X-ray data and find 
H<SUB>0</SUB>=77.6<SUP>+4.8</SUP><SUB>-4.3</SUB><SUP>+10.1</SUP><SUB>-8.2</SUB> 
km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> (statistical followed by systematic 
uncertainty at 68% confidence). The consistency between the models 
illustrates the relative insensitivity of SZE/X-ray determinations of 
H<SUB>0</SUB> to the details of the cluster model. Our determination of 
the Hubble parameter in the distant universe agrees with the recent 
measurement from the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project that probes the 
nearby universe.

                               Abstract
The WMAP Q-, V-, and W-band radial profiles of temperature deviation of 
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) were constructed for a sample of 
31 randomly selected nearby clusters of galaxies in directions of 
Galactic latitude b>30<SUP>deg</SUP>. The profiles were compared in 
detail with the expected CMB Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) caused by 
these clusters, with the hot gas properties of each cluster inferred 
observationally by applying gas temperatures as measured by ASCA to 
isothermal β-models of the ROSAT X-ray surface brightness profiles, 
with the WMAP point-spread function fully taken into consideration. 
After co-adding the 31 cluster fields to significantly reduce the 
systematic and random uncertainties, it appears that WMAP detected the 
SZE in all three bands. Quantitatively, however, the observed SZE only 
accounts for about 1/4 of the expected decrement. The discrepancy 
represents too much unexplained extra flux: in the W band, the detected 
SZE corresponds on average to 5.6 times less X-ray gas mass within a 10' 
radius than the mass value given by the ROSAT β-model. We 
critically examined how the X-ray prediction of the SZE may depend on 
our uncertainties in the density and temperature of the hot intracluster 
plasma, and emission by cluster radio sources. Although our comparison 
between the detected and expected SZE levels is subject to a margin of 
error, the fact remains that the average observed SZE depth and profile 
are consistent with those of the primary CMB anisotropy, i.e., the 
overall WMAP temperature decrement among the 31 rich clusters is too 
shallow to necessitate an interpretation in terms of an additional 
effect like the SZE. A unique aspect of this SZE investigation is that 
because all the data being analyzed are in the public domain, our work 
is readily open to scrutiny by others.

                               Abstract
This work investigates alternative theories of gravity, the solutions to 
their field equations and the constraints that can be imposed upon them 
from observation and experiment. Specifically, we consider the 
cosmologies and spherically symmetric solutions that can be expected to 
result from scalar-tensor and fourth-order theories of gravity. We find 
exact cosmological solutions of various different kinds; isotropic and 
anisotropic, homogeneous and inhomogeneous. These solutions are used to 
investigate the behaviour of the Universes at both late and early times, 
to investigate the effects of corrections to general relativity on 
approach to an initial singularity and to look for effects which may be 
observable in the present day Universe. We use physical processes, such 
as the primordial nucleosynthesis of the light elements, to impose 
constraints upon any deviations from the standard model. Furthermore, we 
investigate the vacuum spherically symmetric solutions of these 
theories. This environment is of particular interest for considerations 
of the local effects of gravity, where the most accurate experiments and 
observations of gravitational phenomena can be performed. Exact 
solutions are obtained for this situation and their stability analysed. 
It is found that a variety of new behaviour is obtainable in these 
theories that was not previously possible in the standard model. This 
new behaviour allows us an extended framework in which to consider 
gravitational physics, and its cosmological consequences.

The old dream of integrating into one the study of micro and macrocosmos 
is now a reality. Cosmology, astrophysics and particle physics converge 
within a scenario (but still not a theory) of cosmic structure formation

                               Abstract
We use galaxy and dark halo data from the public database for the 
Millennium Simulation to study the growth of galaxies in the De Lucia et 
al. model for galaxy formation. Previous work has shown this model to 
reproduce many aspects of the systematic properties and the clustering 
of real galaxies, both in the nearby universe and at high redshift. It 
assumes the stellar masses of galaxies to increase through three 
processes, major mergers, the accretion of smaller satellite systems and 
star formation. We show the relative importance of these three modes to 
be a strong function of stellar mass and redshift. Galaxy growth through 
major mergers depends strongly on stellar mass, but only weakly on 
redshift. Except for massive systems, minor mergers contribute more to 
galaxy growth than major mergers at all redshifts and stellar masses. 
For galaxies significantly less massive than the Milky Way, star 
formation dominates the growth at all epochs. For galaxies significantly 
more massive than the Milky Way, growth through mergers is the dominant 
process at all epochs. At a stellar mass of 6 × 
10<SUP>10</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, about that of the Milk Way, star 
formation dominates at z > 1 and mergers at later times. At every 
stellar mass, the growth rates through star formation increase rapidly 
with increasing redshift. Specific star formation rates are the 
decreasing function of stellar mass not only at z = 0 but also at all 
higher redshifts. For comparison, we carry out a similar analysis of the 
growth of dark matter haloes. In contrast to the galaxies, growth rates 
depend strongly on redshift, but only weakly on mass. They agree 
qualitatively with analytic predictions for halo growth.

                               Abstract
We use the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism to study halo 
assembly histories in a standard Λ cold dark matter cosmology. A 
large ensemble of Monte Carlo random walks provides the entire halo 
membership histories of a representative set of dark matter particles, 
which we assume to be neutralinos. The first-generation haloes of most 
particles do not have a mass similar to the free-streaming cut-off 
M<SUB>fs</SUB> of the neutralino power spectrum, nor do they form at 
high redshift. Median values are M<SUB>1</SUB> = 
10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP>M<SUB>fs</SUB> and z<SUB>1</SUB> = 13 to 8 
depending on the form of the collapse barrier assumed in the EPS model. 
For almost one third of all particles, the first-generation halo has 
M<SUB>1</SUB> > 10<SUP>9</SUP>M<SUB>fs</SUB>. At redshifts beyond 20, 
most neutralinos are not yet part of any halo but are still diffuse. 
These numbers apply with little modification to the neutralinos which 
are today part of haloes similar to that of the Milky Way. Up to 10 per 
cent of the particles in such haloes were never part of a smaller 
object; the typical particle has undergone approximately five `accretion 
events' where the halo it was part of falls into a more massive object. 
Available N-body simulations agree well with the EPS predictions for an 
`ellipsoidal' collapse barrier, so these may provide a reliable 
extension of simulation results to smaller scales. The late formation 
times and large masses of the first-generation haloes of most 
neutralinos suggest that they will be disrupted with high efficiency 
during halo assembly.

                               Abstract
For any assumed standard stellar initial mass function, the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) gives a precise determination of the abundance 
of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass over the full stellar 
mass range 10<SUP>8</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> < M<SUB>*</SUB> < 
10<SUP>12</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Within the concordance Λ cold 
dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, the Millennium Simulations give 
precise halo abundances as a function of mass and redshift for all 
haloes within which galaxies can form. Under the plausible hypothesis 
that the stellar mass of a galaxy is an increasing function of the 
maximum mass ever attained by its halo, these results combine to give 
halo mass as a function of stellar mass. The result agrees quite well 
with observational estimates of mean halo mass as a function of stellar 
mass from stacking analyses of the gravitational lensing signal and the 
satellite dynamics of SDSS galaxies. For M<SUB>*</SUB> ~ 5.5 × 
10<SUP>10</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, the stellar mass usually assumed for 
the Milky Way (MW), the implied halo mass is ~2 × 
10<SUP>12</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, consistent with most recent direct 
estimates and inferences from the MW/M31 timing argument. The fraction 
of the baryons associated with each halo which are present as stars in 
its central galaxy reaches a maximum of 20 per cent at masses somewhat 
below that of the MW and falls rapidly at both higher and lower masses. 
These conversion efficiencies are lower than in almost all recent 
high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation, showing that these are 
not yet viable models for the formation of typical members of the galaxy 
population. When inserted in the Millennium-II Simulation, our derived 
relation between stellar mass and halo mass predicts a stellar mass 
autocorrelation function in excellent agreement with that measured 
directly in the SDSS. The implied Tully-Fisher relation also appears 
consistent with observation, suggesting that galaxy luminosity functions 
and Tully-Fisher relations can be reproduced simultaneously in a 
ΛCDM cosmology.

                               Abstract
We demonstrate that the output of a cosmological N-body simulation can, 
to remarkable accuracy, be scaled to represent the growth of large-scale 
structure in a cosmology with parameters similar to but different from 
those originally assumed. Our algorithm involves three steps: a 
reassignment of length, mass and velocity units; a relabelling of the 
time axis and a rescaling of the amplitudes of individual large-scale 
fluctuation modes. We test it using two matched pairs of simulations. 
Within each pair, one simulation assumes parameters consistent with 
analyses of the first-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 
data. The other has lower matter and baryon densities and a 15 per cent 
lower fluctuation amplitude, consistent with analyses of the three-year 
WMAP data. The pairs differ by a factor of a thousand in mass 
resolution, enabling performance tests on both linear and non-linear 
scales. Our scaling reproduces the mass power spectra of the target 
cosmology to better than 0.5 per cent on large scales (k < 
0.1hMpc<SUP>-1</SUP>) both in real and in redshift space. In particular, 
the baryonic acoustic oscillation features of the original cosmology are 
removed and are correctly replaced by those of the target cosmology. 
Errors are still below 3 per cent for k < 1hMpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Power 
spectra of the dark halo distribution are even more precisely 
reproduced, with errors below 1 per cent on all scales tested. A 
halo-by-halo comparison shows that centre-of-mass positions and 
velocities are reproduced to better than 90h<SUP>-1</SUP>kpc and 5 per 
cent, respectively. Halo masses, concentrations and spins are also 
reproduced at about the 10 per cent level, although with small biases. 
Halo assembly histories are accurately reproduced, leading to central 
galaxy magnitudes with errors of about 0.25mag and a bias of about 
0.13mag for a representative semi-analytic model. This algorithm will 
enable a systematic exploration of the coupling between cosmological 
parameter estimates and uncertainties in galaxy formation in future 
large-scale structure surveys.

                               Abstract
The Missing Satellites Problem (MSP) broadly refers to the overabundance 
of predicted Cold Dark Matter (CDM) subhalos compared to satellite 
galaxies known to exist in the Local Group. The most popular 
interpretation of the MSP is that the smallest dark matter halos in the 
universe are extremely inefficient at forming stars. The question from 
that standpoint is to identify the feedback source that makes small 
halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where the truncation 
in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most exciting 
developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery of 
a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide 
field, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite 
count in less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint 
galaxies that are less luminous that some star clusters. For the first 
time, there are empirical reasons to believe that there really are 
missing satellite galaxies in the Local Group, lurking just beyond our 
ability to detect them, or simply inhabiting a region of the sky that 
has yet to have been surveyed. Both kinematic studies and 
completeness-correction studies seem to point to a characteristic 
potential well depth for satellite subhalos that is quite close to the 
mass scale where photoionization and atomic cooling should limit galaxy 
formation. Among the more pressing problems associated with this 
interpretation is to understand the selection biases that limit our 
ability to detect the lowest mass galaxies. The least massive satellite 
halos are likely to host stealth galaxies with very-low surface 
brightness and this may be an important limitation in the hunt for 
low-mass fossils from the epoch of reionization.

                               Abstract
We review the current theory of how galaxies form within the 
cosmological framework provided by the cold dark matter paradigm for 
structure formation. Beginning with the pre-galactic evolution of 
baryonic material we describe the analytical and numerical understanding 
of how baryons condense into galaxies, what determines the structure of 
those galaxies and how internal and external processes (including star 
formation, merging, active galactic nuclei, etc.) determine their gross 
properties and evolution. Throughout, we highlight successes and 
failures of current galaxy formation theory. We include a review of 
computational implementations of galaxy formation theory and assess 
their ability to provide reliable modeling of this complex phenomenon. 
We finish with a discussion of several “hot topics” in 
contemporary galaxy formation theory and assess future directions for 
this field.

                               Abstract
We study the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect potentially generated by 
relativistic electrons injected from dark matter annihilation or decay 
in the Galaxy, and check whether it could be observed by Planck or the 
Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), or even imprint the current CMB 
data as, e.g., the specific fluctuation excess claimed from an recent 
reanalysis of the WMAP-5 data. We focus on high-latitude regions to 
avoid contamination of the Galactic astrophysical electron foreground, 
and consider the annihilation or decay coming from the smooth dark 
matter halo as well as from subhalos, further extending our analysis to 
a generic modeling of spikes arising around intermediate-mass black 
holes. We show that all these dark Galactic components are unlikely to 
produce any observable Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect. For a 
self-annihilating dark matter particle of 10 GeV with canonical 
properties, the largest optical depth we find is 
τ<SUB>e</SUB>≲10<SUP>-7</SUP> for massive isolated subhalos 
hosting intermediate-mass black holes. We conclude that dark matter 
annihilation or decay on the Galactic scale cannot lead to significant 
Sunyaev-Zel’dovich distortions of the CMB spectrum.

                               Abstract
Predictions of the concordance cosmological model (CCM) of the 
structures in the environment of large spiral galaxies are compared with 
observed properties of Local Group galaxies. Five new, most probably 
irreconcilable problems are uncovered: 1) A wide variety of published 
CCM models consistently predict some form of relation between 
dark-matter-mass and luminosity for the Milky Way (MW) satellite 
galaxies, but none is observed. 2) The mass function of luminous 
sub-haloes predicted by the CCM contains too few satellites with dark 
matter (DM) mass ≈ 10<SUP>7</SUP> M_⊙ within their innermost 300 
pc than in the case of the MW satellites. 3) The Local Group galaxies 
and data from extragalactic surveys indicate there is a correlation 
between bulge-mass and the number of luminous satellites that is not 
predicted by the CCM. 4) The 13 new ultra-faint MW satellites define a 
disc-of-satellites (DoS) that is virtually identical to the DoS 
previously found for the 11 classical MW satellites, implying that most 
of the 24 MW satellites are correlated in phase-space. 5) The occurrence 
of two MW-type DM halo masses hosting MW-like galaxies is unlikely in 
the CCM. However, the properties of the Local Group galaxies provide 
information leading to a solution of the above problems. The DoS and 
bulge-satellite correlation suggest that dissipational events forming 
bulges are related to the processes forming phase-space correlated 
satellite populations. These events are well known to occur since in 
galaxy encounters energy and angular momentum are expelled in the form 
of tidal tails, which can fragment to form populations of tidal-dwarf 
galaxies (TDGs) and associated star clusters. If Local Group satellite 
galaxies are to be interpreted as TDGs then the substructure predictions 
of the CCM are internally in conflict. All findings thus suggest that 
the CCM does not account for the Local Group observations and that 
therefore existing as well as new viable alternatives have to be further 
explored. These are discussed and natural solutions for the above 
problems emerge.

I give a review of the development of the concept of dark matter. The 
dark matter story passed through several stages from a minor 
observational puzzle to a major challenge for theory of elementary 
particles. Modern data suggest that dark matter is the dominant matter 
component in the Universe, and that it consists of some unknown 
non-baryonic particles. Dark matter is the dominant matter component in 
the Universe, thus properties of dark matter particles determine the 
structure of the cosmic web.

                               Abstract
We have updated and extended our semi-analytic galaxy formation 
modelling capabilities and applied them simultaneously to the stored 
halo/subhalo merger trees of the Millennium and Millennium-II 
Simulations (MS and MS-II, respectively). These differ by a factor of 
125 in mass resolution, allowing explicit testing of resolution effects 
on predicted galaxy properties. We have revised the treatment of the 
transition between the rapid infall and cooling flow regimes of gas 
accretion, of the sizes of bulges, and of gaseous and stellar discs, of 
supernova feedback, of the transition between central and satellite 
status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and star 
stripping, once they become satellites. Plausible values of efficiency 
and scaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed 
abundance of low-redshift galaxies over five orders of magnitude in 
stellar mass and 9 mag in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance 
of Milky Way satellites. This suggests that reionization effects may not 
be needed to solve the 'missing-satellite' problem, except, perhaps, for 
the faintest objects. The same model matches the observed large-scale 
clustering of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and colour. The fit 
remains excellent down to ˜30 kpc for massive galaxies. For 
M<SUB>*</SUB> < 6 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, however, 
the model overpredicts clustering at scales below ˜1 Mpc, 
suggesting that the assumed fluctuation amplitude, σ<SUB>8</SUB>= 
0.9, is too high. The observed difference in clustering between active 
and passive galaxies is matched quite well for all masses. Galaxy 
distributions within rich clusters agree between the simulations and 
match those observed, but only if galaxies without dark matter subhaloes 
(so-called orphans) are included. Even at MS-II resolution, schemes 
which assign galaxies only to resolved dark matter subhaloes cannot 
match observed clusters. Our model predicts a larger passive fraction 
among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as an overabundance of 
˜10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> galaxies beyond z˜ 0.6. 
(The abundance of ˜10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> galaxies is 
matched out to z˜ 3.) These discrepancies appear to reflect 
deficiencies in the way star formation rates are modelled.

                               Abstract
In this review we present a thoroughly comprehensive survey of recent 
work on modified theories of gravity and their cosmological 
consequences. Amongst other things, we cover General Relativity, 
scalar-tensor, Einstein-æther, and Bimetric theories, as well as 
TeVeS, f(R), general higher-order theories, Hořava-Lifschitz 
gravity, Galileons, Ghost Condensates, and models of extra dimensions 
including Kaluza-Klein, Randall-Sundrum, DGP, and higher co-dimension 
braneworlds. We also review attempts to construct a Parameterised 
Post-Friedmannian formalism, that can be used to constrain deviations 
from General Relativity in cosmology, and that is suitable for 
comparison with data on the largest scales. These subjects have been 
intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid 
progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for 
the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of 
the observable Universe. The purpose of this review is to provide a 
reference tool for researchers and students in cosmology and 
gravitational physics, as well as a self-contained, comprehensive and 
up-to-date introduction to the subject as a whole.

                               Abstract
We study the concentration of dark matter haloes and its evolution in 
N-body simulations of the standard Λ cold dark matter 
(ΛCDM) cosmology. The results presented in this paper are based 
on four large N-body simulations with ˜10 billion particles each: 
the Millennium-I and -II, Bolshoi and MultiDark simulations. The 
MultiDark (or BigBolshoi) simulation is introduced in this paper. This 
suite of simulations with high mass resolution over a large volume 
allows us to compute with unprecedented accuracy the concentration over 
a large range of scales (about six orders of magnitude in mass), which 
constitutes the state of the art of our current knowledge on this basic 
property of dark matter haloes in the ΛCDM cosmology. We find 
that there is consistency among the different simulation data sets, 
despite the different codes, numerical algorithms and halo/subhalo 
finders used in our analysis. We confirm a novel feature for halo 
concentrations at high redshifts: a flattening and upturn with 
increasing mass. The concentration c(M, z) as a function of mass and the 
redshift and for different cosmological parameters shows a remarkably 
complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms of the linear rms 
fluctuation of the density field σ(M, z), the halo concentration 
c(σ) shows a nearly universal simple U-shaped behaviour with a 
minimum at a well-defined scale at σ˜ 0.71. Yet, some small 
dependences with redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass 
end (σ < 1), the median halo kinematic profiles show large 
signatures of infall and highly radial orbits. This c-σ(M, z) 
relation can be accurately parametrized and provides an analytical model 
for the dependence of concentration on halo mass. When applied to galaxy 
clusters, our estimates of concentrations are substantially larger - by 
a factor up to 1.5 - than previous results from smaller simulations, and 
are in much better agreement with results of observations.

                               Abstract
In the past decade or so observations of supernovae, large scale 
structures, and the cosmic microwave background have confirmed the 
presence of what is called dark energy—the cause of the 
accelerating expansion of the Universe. Its density has also been 
measured as well as the value of other cosmological parameters according 
to the concordance ΛCDM model with few percent uncertainties. The 
next generation of surveys should allow to constrain this model with 
better precision or to distinguish between a ΛCDM and alternative 
models such as modified gravity and (interacting)-quintessence models. 
In this work we parametrize both the homogeneous and anisotropic 
components of matter density in the context of interacting dark energy 
models with the goal of discriminating between f(R) modified gravity and 
its generalizations, and interacting dark energy models, for which we 
also propose a phenomenological description of energy-momentum 
conservation equations inspired by particle physics. It is based on the 
fact that the simplest interactions between particles/fields are elastic 
scattering and decay. The parametrization of the growth rate proposed 
here is nonetheless general and can be used to constrain other 
interactions. As an example of applications, we present an order of 
magnitude estimation of the accuracy of the measurement of these 
parameters using Euclid and Planck surveys data, and leave a better 
estimation to a dedicated work.

                               Abstract
We calculate the energy that baryons must inject into cold dark matter 
(CDM) halos in order to remove centrally divergent DM cusps on scales 
relevant to observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We 
estimate that the CDM halos often associated with the Milky Way's dSphs 
(M <SUB>vir</SUB>/M <SUB>⊙</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>9-10</SUP>) require 
ΔE ~ 10<SUP>53-55</SUP> erg in order to form cores on scales 
comparable to the luminous size of these galaxies. While supernova Type 
II (SNeII) explosions can in principle generate this energy, the actual 
contribution is limited by the low star formation efficiency implied by 
the abundance of luminous satellites. Considering that CDM's well-known 
"core/cusp" and "missing satellite" problems place opposing demands on 
star formation efficiencies, existing observational evidences for large 
cores in the most luminous dSphs require that CDM models invoke some 
combination of the following: (1) efficient (of the order of unity) 
coupling of SNeII energy into dark matter particles, (2) star formation 
histories peaking at unexpectedly high redshifts (z >~ 6), (3) a 
top-heavy stellar initial mass function, and/or (4) substantial 
satellite disruption or other stochastic effects to ease the 
substructure abundance constraints. Our models show that the tension 
between CDM problems on small scales would increase if cored DM profiles 
were to be found in fainter dwarfs.

                               Abstract
The recent discovery of dark energy has prompted an investigation of 
ways in which the accelerated expansion of the universe can be realized. 
In this dissertation, we present two separate projects related to dark 
energy. The first project analyzes a class of braneworld models in which 
multiple branes float in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk, while 
the second investigates a class of dark energy models from an effective 
field theory perspective. Investigations of models including extra 
dimensions have led to modifications of gravity involving a number of 
interesting features. In particular, the Randall-Sundrum model is 
well-known for achieving an amelioration of the hierarchy problem. 
However, the basic model relies on Minkowski branes and is subject to 
solar system constraints in the absence of a radion stabilization 
mechanism. We present a method by which a four-dimensional low-energy 
description can be obtained for braneworld scenarios, allowing for a 
number of generalizations to the original models. This method is applied 
to orbifolded and uncompactified  N-brane models, deriving an effective 
four-dimensional action. The parameter space of this theory is 
constrained using observational evidence, and it is found that the 
generalizations do not weaken solar system constraints on the original 
model. Furthermore, we find that general  N-brane systems are 
qualitatively similar to the two-brane case, and do not naturally lead 
to a viable dark energy model. We next investigate dark energy models 
using effective field theory techniques. We describe dark energy through 
a quintessence field, employing a derivative expansion. To the accuracy 
of the model, we find transformations to write the description in a form 
involving no higher-order derivatives in the equations of motion. We use 
a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson construction to motivate the theory, and 
find the regime of validity and scaling of the operators using this. The 
regime of validity is restricted to a class of models for which both the 
derivative expansion and EFT construction is valid, which forces the 
quintessence potential to be the dominant source of energy-density in 
this class of model. The resulting effective theory is described by nine 
free functions.

early universe and how we can detect it today? Where does the WIMP 
miracle come from, and is it really a "WIMP" miracle? What brackets the 
mass range for thermal relics? Where does <\sigma v> come from, 
and what does it mean? What is the difference between chemical and 
kinetic decoupling? Why do some people think that dark matter cannot be 
lighter than 40 GeV? Why is b\bar b such a popular annihilation final 
state? Why is antimatter a good way to look for dark matter? Why should 
the cosmic-ray positron fraction decline with energy, and why does it 
not? How does one calculate the flux of neutrinos from dark matter 
annihilation in a celestial body, and when is that flux independent of 
the dark matter pair-annihilation rate? How does dark matter produce 
photons? Read these lecture notes, do the suggested 10 exercises, and

                               Abstract
We present a new analysis of the Aquarius simulations done in 
combination with a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. Our goal is to 
establish whether the subhaloes present in Λ cold dark matter 
simulations of Milky Way (MW) like systems could host the dwarf 
spheroidal (dSph) satellites of our Galaxy. Our analysis shows that, 
contrary to what has been assumed in most previous work, the mass 
profiles of subhaloes are generally not well fitted by 
Navarro-Frenk-White models but that Einasto profiles are preferred. We 
find that for shape parameters α = 0.2-0.5 and v<SUB>max</SUB> = 
10-30 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> there is very good correspondence with the 
observational constraints obtained for the nine brightest dSphs of the 
MW. However, to explain the internal dynamics of these systems as well 
as the number of objects of a given circular velocity the total mass of 
the MW should be ˜8 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a 
value that is in agreement with many recent determinations, and at the 
low-mass end of the range explored by the Aquarius simulations. Our 
simulations show important scatter in the number of bright satellites, 
even when the Aquarius MW-like hosts are scaled to a common mass, and we 
find no evidence for a missing population of massive subhaloes in the 
Galaxy. This conclusion is also supported when we examine the dynamics 
of the satellites of M31.

                               Abstract
We study the effect of baryons on the abundance of structures and 
substructures in a Λ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology, using a 
pair of high-resolution cosmological simulations from the 
Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation project. Both 
simulations use identical initial conditions, but while one contains 
only dark matter, the other also includes baryons. We find that gas 
pressure, reionization, supernova feedback, stripping and truncated 
accretion systematically reduce the total mass and the abundance of 
structures below ˜10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> compared to 
the pure dark matter simulation. Taking this into account and adopting 
an appropriate detection threshold lower the abundance of observed 
galaxies with maximum circular velocities v<SUB>max</SUB> < 100 km 
s<SUP>-1</SUP>, significantly reducing the reported discrepancy between 
ΛCDM and the measured H I velocity function of the Arecibo Legacy 
Fast ALFA survey. We also show that the stellar-to-total mass ratios of 
galaxies with stellar masses of ˜10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB> inferred from abundance matching of the (sub)halo mass 
function to the observed galaxy mass function increase by a factor of 
˜2. In addition, we find that an important fraction of low-mass 
subhaloes are completely devoid of stars. Accounting for the presence of 
dark subhaloes below 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> further reduces 
the abundance of observable objects and leads to an additional increase 
in the inferred stellar-to-total mass ratio by factors of 2-10 for 
galaxies in haloes of 10<SUP>9</SUP>-10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. 
This largely reconciles the abundance matching results with the 
kinematics of individual dwarf galaxies in ΛCDM. We propose 
approximate corrections to the masses of objects derived from pure dark 
matter calculations to account for baryonic effects.

                               Abstract
We use the Millennium Simulation series to investigate the relation 
between the accretion history and mass profile of cold dark matter (CDM) 
haloes. We find that the mean inner density within the scale radius, 
r<SUB>-2</SUB> (where the halo density profile has isothermal slope), is 
directly proportional to the critical density of the Universe at the 
time when the virial mass of the main progenitor equals the mass 
enclosed within r<SUB>-2</SUB>. Scaled to these characteristic values of 
mass and density, the average mass accretion history, expressed in terms 
of the critical density of the Universe, M(ρ<SUB>crit</SUB>(z)), 
resembles that of the enclosed density profile, M(<ρ>), at z = 
0. Both follow closely the Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) profile, 
which suggests that the similarity of halo mass profiles originates from 
the mass-independence of halo accretion histories. Support for this 
interpretation is provided by outlier haloes whose accretion histories 
deviate from the NFW shape; their mass profiles show correlated 
deviations from NFW and are better approximated by Einasto profiles. 
Fitting both M(<ρ>) and M(ρ<SUB>crit</SUB>) with either 
NFW or Einasto profiles yield concentration and shape parameters that 
are correlated, confirming and extending earlier work that has linked 
the concentration of a halo with its accretion history. These 
correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive to initial 
conditions: only haloes whose accretion histories differ greatly from 
the NFW shape show notable deviations from NFW in their mass profiles. 
As a result, the NFW profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter 
haloes, which do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power 
spectra other than CDM. Our findings, however, predict a subtle but 
systematic dependence of mass profile shape on accretion history which, 
if confirmed, would provide strong support for the link between 
accretion history and halo structure we propose here.

                               Abstract
We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the 
local universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and dark 
matter halos and their constituent substructures in the Λ-cold 
dark matter model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for 
the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the 
relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a 
high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We 
associate galaxies with dark matter halos and subhalos using subhalo 
abundance matching, and perform a comprehensive analysis which 
investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (1) 
which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar 
masses and luminosities, (2) how much scatter is in this relationship, 
and (3) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are 
destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the 
projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional 
stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. We find that an abundance 
matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity 
of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of 0.20 
± 0.03 dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. 
This confirms the theoretical expectation that the stellar mass of 
galaxies is tightly correlated with the potential wells of their dark 
matter halos before they are impacted by larger structures. The data put 
tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of 
galaxy stellar mass and on the scatter between halo and galaxy 
properties, and rule out several alternative abundance matching models 
that have been considered. This will yield important constraints for 
galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that 
the galaxy-halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for 
future precision studies of the dark universe.

                               Abstract
In this paper, we investigate how the dark matter halo mass function 
evolves with redshift, based on a suite of very large (with 
N<SUB>p</SUB> = 3072<SUP>3</SUP>-6000<SUP>3</SUP> particles) 
cosmological N-body simulations. Our halo catalogue data span a redshift 
range of z = 0-30, allowing us to probe the mass function from the Dark 
Ages to the present. We utilize both the friends-of-friends (FOF) and 
spherical overdensity (SO) halo-finding methods to directly compare the 
mass function derived using these commonly used halo definitions. The 
mass function from SO haloes exhibits a clear evolution with redshift, 
especially during the recent era of dark energy dominance (z < 1). We 
provide a redshift-parametrized fit for the SO mass function valid for 
the entire redshift range to within ˜20 per cent as well as a 
scheme to calculate the mass function for haloes with arbitrary 
overdensities. The FOF mass function displays a weaker evolution with 
redshift. We provide a `universal' fit for the FOF mass function, fitted 
to data across the entire redshift range simultaneously, and observe 
redshift evolution in our data versus this fit. The relative evolution 
of the mass functions derived via the two methods is compared. For an SO 
halo defined via an overdensity of 178 versus the background matter 
density and an FOF halo defined via a linking length of 0.2 times the 
mean interparticle separation we find that the mass functions most 
closely match at z = 0. The disparity at z = 0 between the FOF and SO 
mass functions resides in their high-mass tails where the collapsed 
fraction of mass in SO haloes is ˜80 per cent of that in FOF 
haloes. This difference grows with redshift so that, by z > 20, the 
SO algorithm finds a ˜50-80 per cent lower collapsed fraction in 
high-mass haloes than the FOF algorithm.

Using a newly developed modeling technique, we present orbit-based 
dynamical models of the Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans 
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. These models calculate the dark matter 
profiles non-parametrically without requiring any assumptions to be made 
about their profile shapes. By lifting this restriction, we discover a 
host of dark matter profiles in the dSphs that are different from the 
typical profiles suggested by both theorists and observers. However, 
when we scale these profiles appropriately and plot them on a common 
axis, they appear to follow an approximate r <SUP>-1</SUP> power 
law with considerable scatter.

                               Abstract
The characteristic prediction of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model of 
cosmological structure formation is that the Universe should contain a 
wealth of small-scale structure-low-mass dark matter haloes and 
subhaloes. However, galaxy formation is inefficient in their shallow 
potential wells and so we expect these low-mass haloes and subhaloes to 
be dark. Can we tell the difference between a Universe in which these 
low-mass haloes are present but dark and one in which they never formed, 
thereby providing a robust test of the CDM model? We address this 
question using cosmological N-body simulations to examine how properties 
of low-mass haloes that are potentially accessible to observation, such 
as their spatial clustering, rate of accretions and mergers onto massive 
galaxies, and the angular momentum content of massive galaxies, differ 
between a fiducial ΛCDM model and dark matter models in which 
low-mass halo formation is suppressed. Adopting an effective cut-off 
mass scale M <SUB>cut</SUB> below which small-scale power is suppressed 
in the initial conditions, we study dark matter models in which M 
<SUB>cut</SUB> varies between 5×10<SUP>9</SUP> h 
<SUP>-1</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 10<SUP>11</SUP> h 
<SUP>-1</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, equivalent to the host haloes of 
dwarf and low-mass galaxies. Our results show that both the clustering 
strength of low-mass haloes around galaxy-mass primaries and the rate at 
which they merge with these primaries are sensitive to the assumed value 
of M <SUB>cut</SUB>; in contrast, suppressing low-mass halo formation 
has little influence on the angular momentum content of galaxy-mass 
haloes-it is the quiescence or violence of a halo's assembly history 
that has a more marked effect. However, we expect that measuring the 
effect on spatial clustering or the merger rate is likely to be 
observationally difficult for realistic values of M <SUB>cut</SUB>, and 
so isolating the effect of this small-scale structure would appear to be 
remarkably difficult to detect, at least in the present day Universe.

                               Abstract
A brief overview is given about some issues in current astroparticle 
physics, focusing on the dark matter (DM) problem, where the connection 
to Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics is particularly strong. New data 
from the Planck satellite has made the evidence in favour of the 
existence of DM even stronger. The favourite, though not the only, 
candidates for cosmological DM, weakly interacting massive particles, 
are being probed by a variety of experiments—direct detection 
through scattering in terrestrial detectors, indirect detection by 
observing products of annihilation of DM in the Galaxy and finally 
searches at accelerators such as the LHC. The field is in the 
interesting situation that all of these search methods are reaching 
sensitivities where signals of DM may plausibly soon be found, and a 
vast array of models will be probed in the next few years. Of course, 
expectations for a positive signature are high, which calls for caution 
regarding ‘false alarms’. Some of the presently puzzling and 
partly conflicting pieces of evidence for DM detection are discussed as 
well as expectations for the future.

                               Abstract
We study through a semi-analytic model how the inner slopes of relaxed 
Λ CDM dark matter halos with and without baryons depend on the 
halo mass. We find that the inner logarithmic density slope, α 
≡ d log ρ /d log r, of dark matter halos with baryons has a 
significant dependence on the halo mass with slopes ranging from α 
≃ 0 for dwarf galaxies to ≃ 1 for clusters of galaxies. In the 
case of density profiles constituted just of dark matter, the mass 
dependence of slope is very slight. In the presence of baryons, the 
universality of the dark matter density profiles is no longer valid, in 
agreement with the results of several other authors, including the 
recent Di Cintio et al. (2014) simulations.

                               Abstract
This paper is a broadband review of the current status of nonbaryonic 
dark matter (DM) research, starting from a historical overview of the 
evidences of existence of DM, then discussing how DM is distributed from 
small scale to large scale, continuing with a discussion on DM nature, 
DM candidates and their detection. I finally discuss some of the limits 
of the ΛCDM model, with particular emphasis on the small scale 
problems of the paradigm.

                               Abstract
We compare spherically averaged radial number counts of bright 
(≳10<SUP>5</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) dwarf satellite galaxies within 
400 kpc of the Milky Way (MW) and M31 and find that the MW satellites 
are much more centrally concentrated. Remarkably, the two satellite 
systems are almost identical within the central 100 kpc, while M31 
satellites outnumber MW satellites by about a factor of 4 at deprojected 
distances spanning 100-400 kpc. We compare the observed distributions to 
those predicted for Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) subhaloes 
using a suite of 44 high-resolution ˜10<SUP>12</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB> halo zoom simulations, 22 of which are in pairs like 
the MW and M31. We find that the radial distribution of satellites 
around M31 is fairly typical of those predicted for subhaloes, while the 
MW's distribution is more centrally concentrated than any of our 
simulated ΛCDM haloes. One possible explanation is that our 
census of bright (≳10<SUP>5</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) MW dwarf 
galaxies is significantly incomplete beyond ˜100 kpc of the Sun. 
If there were ˜8-20 more bright dwarfs orbiting undetected at 
100-400 kpc distance, then the MW's radial distribution would fall 
within the range expected from subhalo distributions and also look very 
much like the known M31 system. We use our simulations to demonstrate 
that there is enough area left unexplored by the Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey and its extensions that the discovery of ˜10 new bright 
dwarfs is not implausible given the expected range of angular anisotropy 
of subhaloes in the sky.

                               Abstract
We study, by means of the model proposed in Del Popolo (2009), the 
effect of baryon physics on the small scale problems of the CDM model. 
We show that, using this model, the cusp/core problem, the missing 
satellite problem (MSP), the Too Big to Fail (TBTF) problem, and the 
angular momentum catastrophe can be reconciled with observations. 
Concerning the cusp/core problem, the interaction among dark matter (DM) 
and baryonic clumps of 1% the mass of the halo, through dynamical 
friction (DF), is able to flatten the inner cusp of the density 
profiles. We moreover assume that haloes form primarily through 
quiescent accretion, in agreement with the spherical collapse model 
(SCM)-secondary infall model (SIM) prescriptions. The results of this 
paper follow from the two assumptions above. Concerning the MSP and TBTF 
problem, applying to the Via Lactea II (VL2) subhaloes a series of 
corrections similar to those of Brooks et al. (2013), namely applying a 
Zolotov et al. (2012)-like correction obtained with our model, and 
further correcting for the UV heating and tidal stripping, we obtain 
that the number of massive, luminous satellites is in agreement with the 
number observed in the MW. The model also produces an angular momentum 
distribution in agreement with observations, that is with the 
distribution of the angular spin parameter and angular momentum of the 
dwarfs studied by van den Bosch, Burkert, & Swaters (2001). In 
conclusion, the small scale problems of the CDM model can all be solved 
by introducing baryon physics.

                               Abstract
We present a new algorithm which groups the subhaloes found in 
cosmological N-body simulations by structure finders such as SUBFIND 
into dark matter haloes whose formation histories are strictly 
hierarchical. One advantage of these `Dhaloes' over the commonly used 
friends-of-friends (FoF) haloes is that they retain their individual 
identity in the cases when FoF haloes are artificially merged by tenuous 
bridges of particles or by an overlap of their outer diffuse haloes. 
Dhaloes are thus well suited for modelling galaxy formation and their 
merger trees form the basis of the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation 
model, GALFORM. Applying the Dhalo construction to the Λ cold 
dark matter Millennium II Simulation, we find that approximately 90 per 
cent of Dhaloes have a one-to-one, bijective match with a corresponding 
FoF halo. The remaining 10 per cent are typically secondary components 
of large FoF haloes. Although the mass functions of both types of haloes 
are similar, the mass of Dhaloes correlates much more tightly with the 
virial mass, M<SUB>200</SUB>, than FoF haloes. Approximately 80 per cent 
of FoF and bijective and non-bijective Dhaloes are relaxed according to 
standard criteria. For these relaxed haloes, all three types have 
similar concentration-M<SUB>200</SUB> relations and, at fixed mass, the 
concentration distributions are described accurately by log-normal 
distributions.

                               Abstract
Previous simulations of the growth of cosmic structures have broadly 
reproduced the `cosmic web' of galaxies that we see in the Universe, but 
failed to create a mixed population of elliptical and spiral galaxies, 
because of numerical inaccuracies and incomplete physical models. 
Moreover, they were unable to track the small-scale evolution of gas and 
stars to the present epoch within a representative portion of the 
Universe. Here we report a simulation that starts 12 million years after 
the Big Bang, and traces 13 billion years of cosmic evolution with 12

yields a reasonable population of ellipticals and spirals, reproduces 
the observed distribution of galaxies in clusters and characteristics of 
hydrogen on large scales, and at the same time matches the `metal' and 
hydrogen content of galaxies on small scales.

                               Abstract
We use the Millennium Simulation series to investigate the mass and 
redshift dependence of the concentration of equilibrium cold dark matter 
(CDM) haloes. We extend earlier work on the relation between halo mass 
profiles and assembly histories to show how the latter may be used to 
predict concentrations for haloes of all masses and at any redshift. Our 
results clarify the link between concentration and the `collapse 
redshift' of a halo as well as why concentration depends on mass and 
redshift solely through the dimensionless `peak height' mass parameter, 
ν(M, z) = δ<SUB>crit</SUB>(z)/σ(M, z). We combine these 
results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the c(M, 
z) relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through direct 
simulation. Our model predicts that, at given z, c(M) should deviate 
systematically from a simple power law at high masses, where 
concentrations approach a constant value, and at low masses, where 
concentrations are substantially lower than expected from extrapolating 
published empirical fits. This correction may reduce the expected 
self-annihilation boost factor from substructure by about one order of 
magnitude. The model also reproduces the c(M, z) dependence on 
cosmological parameters reported in earlier work and thus provides a 
simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology and the 
mass-concentration-redshift relation of CDM haloes.

                               Abstract
In the standard cosmological model, the Universe consists mainly of two 
invisible substances: vacuum energy with constant mass-density 
rho_v=\Lambda/(8pi G) (where Lambda is a `cosmological constant' 
originally proposed by Einstein and G is Newton's gravitational 
constant) and cold dark matter (CDM) with mass density that is currently 
rho_{DM,0}\sim 0.3 rho_v. This `LCDM' model has the virtue of 
simplicity, enabling straightforward calculation of the formation and 
evolution of cosmic structure against the backdrop of cosmic expansion. 
Here we review apparent discrepancies with observations on small 
galactic scales, which LCDM must attribute to complexity in the baryon 
physics of galaxy formation. Yet galaxies exhibit structural scaling 
relations that evoke simplicity, presenting a clear challenge for 
formation models. In particular, tracers of gravitational potentials 
dominated by dark matter show a correlation between orbital size, R, and 
velocity, V, that can be expressed most simply as a characteristic 
acceleration, a_{DM}\sim 1 km^2 s^{-2} pc^{-1} \approx 3 x 10^{-9} cm 
s^{-2} \approx 0.2c\sqrt{G rho_v}, perhaps motivating efforts to find a 
link between localized and global manifestations of the Universe's dark 
components.

                               Abstract
In this paper we review the main theoretical and experimental 
achievements in the field of dark matter from the cosmological and 
astrophysical point of view. We revisit it from the very first surveys 
of local astrophysical matter, up to the stringent constraints on matter 
properties, coming from the last release of data on cosmological scales. 
To bring closer and justify the idea of dark matter, we will go across 
methods and tools for measuring dark matter characteristics, and in some 
cases a combination of methods that provide one of the greatest direct 
proofs for dark matter, such as Bullet cluster.

                               Abstract
We introduce a mass-dependent density profile to describe the 
distribution of dark matter within galaxies, which takes into account 
the stellar-to-halo mass dependence of the response of dark matter to 
baryonic processes. The study is based on the analysis of 
hydrodynamically simulated galaxies from dwarf to Milky Way mass, drawn 
from the Making Galaxies In a Cosmological Context project, which have 
been shown to match a wide range of disc scaling relationships. We find 
that the best-fitting parameters of a generic double power-law density 
profile vary in a systematic manner that depends on the stellar-to-halo 
mass ratio of each galaxy. Thus, the quantity 
M<SUB>⋆</SUB>/M<SUB>halo</SUB> constrains the inner (γ) and 
outer (β) slopes of dark matter density, and the sharpness of 
transition between the slopes (α), reducing the number of free 
parameters of the model to two. Due to the tight relation between 
stellar mass and halo mass, either of these quantities is sufficient to 
describe the dark matter halo profile including the effects of baryons. 
The concentration of the haloes in the hydrodynamical simulations is 
consistent with N-body expectations up to Milky Way-mass galaxies, at 
which mass the haloes become twice as concentrated as compared with pure 
dark matter runs. This mass-dependent density profile can be directly 
applied to rotation curve data of observed galaxies and to semi-analytic 
galaxy formation models as a significant improvement over the commonly 
used NFW profile.

                               Abstract
We present the evolution of the structure of relaxed cold dark matter 
(CDM) haloes in the cosmology from the Planck satellite. Our simulations 
cover five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. 
Because of the increased matter density and power spectrum normalization 
the concentration-mass relation in the Planck cosmology has a ˜20 
per cent higher normalization at redshift z = 0 compared to Wilkinson 
Microwave Anisotropy Probe cosmology. We confirm that CDM haloes are 
better described by the Einasto profile; for example, at scales near 
galaxy half-light radii CDM haloes have significantly steeper density 
profiles than implied by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) fits. There is a 
scatter of ˜0.2 dex in the Einasto shape parameter at fixed halo 
mass, adding further to the diversity of CDM halo profiles. The 
evolution of the concentration-mass relation in our simulations is not 
reproduced by any of the analytic models in the literature. We thus 
provide a simple fitting formula that accurately describes the evolution 
between redshifts z = 5 and 0 for both NFW and Einasto fits. Finally, 
the observed concentrations and halo masses of spiral galaxies, groups 
and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts are in good agreement with our 
simulations, suggesting only mild halo response to galaxy formation on 
these scales.

                               Abstract
We combine observations of the Local Group with data from the NASA-Sloan 
Atlas to show the variation in the quenched fraction of satellite 
galaxies from low-mass dwarf spheroidals and dwarf irregulars to more 
massive dwarfs similar to the Magellanic Clouds. While almost all of the 
low-mass (M <SUB>sstarf</SUB> <~ 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) 
dwarfs are quenched, at higher masses the quenched fraction decreases to 
approximately 40%-50%. This change in the quenched fraction is large and 
suggests a sudden change in the effectiveness of quenching that 
correlates with satellite mass. We combine this observation with models 
of satellite infall and ram pressure stripping to show that the low-mass 
satellites must quench within 1-2 Gyr of pericenter passage to maintain 
a high quenched fraction, but that many more massive dwarfs must 
continue to form stars today even though they likely fell into their 
host >5 Gyr ago. We also characterize how the susceptibility of 
dwarfs to ram pressure must vary as a function of mass if it is to 
account for the change in quenched fractions. Though neither model 
predicts the quenching effectiveness a priori, this modeling illustrates 
the physical requirements that the observed quenched fractions place on 
possible quenching mechanisms.

                               Abstract
The BICEP2 results, when interpreted as a gravitational wave signal and 
combined with other cosmic microwave background data, suggest a roll-off 
in power towards small scales in the primordial matter power spectrum. 
Among the simplest possibilities is a running of the spectral index. 
Here we show that the preferred level of running alleviates small-scale 
issues within the ΛCDM model, more so even than viable WDM 
models. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-sized 
halo along with full-box simulations to compare predictions among four 
separate cosmologies: a BICEP2-inspired running index model 
(α<SUB>s</SUB> = -0.024), two fixed-tilt ΛCDM models 
motivated by Planck, and a 2.6 keV thermal WDM model. We find that the 
running BICEP2 model reduces the central densities of large dwarf-sized 
haloes (V<SUB>max</SUB> ˜ 30-80 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and alleviates 
the too-big-to-fail problem significantly compared to our adopted Planck 
and WDM cases. Further, the BICEP2 model suppresses the count of small 
subhaloes by ˜50 per cent relative to Planck models, and yields a 
significantly lower `boost' factor for dark matter annihilation signals. 
Our findings highlight the need to understand the shape of the 
primordial power spectrum in order to correctly interpret small-scale 
data.

                               Abstract
We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale 
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution 
simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)<SUP>3</SUP>, has 
a dark mass resolution of 6.26 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, 
and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 × 
10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. At z = 0 gravitational forces are 
softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells 
have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 × 
1820<SUP>3</SUP> resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 
1820<SUP>3</SUP> Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle 
count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: 
primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, 
stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, 
supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic 
nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic 
predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with 
observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume 
contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of 
morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular 
galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star 
formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon 
conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the 
impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The 
internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies 
obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat 
circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation 
reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our 
model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the 
halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from 
supernova and active galactic nuclei.

                               Abstract
Accurately predicting structural properties of dark matter halos is one 
of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the new suite of 
MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter 
halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. The 
MultiDark simulations cover a large range of masses 1e10-1e15Msun and 
volumes upto 50Gpc**3. The total number of dark matter halos in all the 
simulations exceeds 60 billion. We find that in order to understand the 
structure of dark matter halos and to make ~1% accurate predictions for 
density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more 
complex than the traditional ratio of the virial radius to the core 
radius in the NFW profile. For massive halos the averge density profile 
is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the 
core radius and the shape parameter alpha in the Einasto approximation. 
Combining results from different redshifts, masses and cosmologies, we 
show that halos progress through three stages of evolution. (1) They 
start as rare density peaks that experience very fast and nearly radial 
infall. This radial infall brings mass closer to the center producing a 
high concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with the 
increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the alpha 
parameter with nearly constant core radius. Later halos slide into (2) 
the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent 
mergers still affect even the central region. Now the concentration does 
not depend on halo mass. (3) Once the rate of accretion slows down, 
halos move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation 
because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the 
core radius is staying constant. We provide accurate analytical fits to 
the numerical results for halo density profiles and concentrations.

                               Abstract
A critical review is given of the current status of cosmological 
nucleosynthesis. In the framework of the Standard Model with 3 types of 
relativistic neutrinos, the baryon-to-photon ratio, $\eta$, 
corresponding to the inferred primordial abundances of deuterium and 
helium-4 is consistent with the independent determination of $\eta$ from 
observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. However 
the primordial abundance of lithium-7 inferred from observations is 
significantly below its expected value. Taking systematic uncertainties 
in the abundance estimates into account, there is overall concordance in 
the range $\eta = (5.7-6.7)\times 10^{-10}$ at 95% CL (corresponding to 
a cosmological baryon density $\Omega_B h^2 = 0.021 - 0.025$). The D and 
He-4 abundances, when combined with the CMB determination of $\eta$, 
provide the bound $N_\nu=3.28 \pm 0.28$ on the effective number of 
neutrino species. Other constraints on new physics are discussed 
briefly.

                               Abstract
We study the impact of gravitational slingshot on the distribution of 
cold dark matter in early and modern era galaxies. Multiple 
gravitational encounters of a lower mass dark matter particle with 
massive baryonic astrophysical bodies would lead to an average energy 
gain for the dark matter, similar to second order Fermi acceleration. We 
calculate the average energy gain and model the integrated effect on the 
dark matter profile. We find that such slingshot effect was most 
effective in the early history of galaxies where first generation stars 
were massive, which smeared the dark matter distribution at the galactic 
center and flattened it from an initial cusp profile. On the other hand, 
slingshot is less effective after the high mass first generation stars 
and stellar remnants are no longer present. Our finding may help to 
resolve the cusp-core problem, and we discuss implications for the 
existing observation-simulation discrepancies and phenomena related to 
galaxy mergers.

                               Abstract
The "Lambda Cold Dark Matter" (LCDM) model of cosmic structure formation 
is eminently falsifiable: once its parameters are fixed on large scales, 
it becomes testable in the nearby Universe. Observations within our 
Local Group of galaxies, including the satellite populations of the 
Milky Way and Andromeda, appear to contradict LCDM predictions: there 
are far fewer satellite galaxies than dark matter halos (the "missing 
satellites" problem), galaxies seem to avoid the largest substructures 
(the "too big to fail" problem), and the brightest satellites appear to 
orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the "planes of satellites" 
problem). We present results from the first hydrodynamic simulations of 
the Local Group that match the observed abundance of galaxies. We find 
that when baryonic and dark matter are followed simultaneously in the 
context of a realistic galaxy formation model, all three "problems" are 
resolved within the LCDM paradigm.

                               Abstract
We present neutral hydrogen (H i) imaging observations with the 
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope of AGC198606, an H i cloud 
discovered in the ALFALFA 21cm survey. This object is of particular note 
as it is located 16 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and 1.̊2 from the gas-bearing 
ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Leo T while having a similar H i linewidth and 
approximately twice the flux density. The H i imaging observations 
reveal a smooth, undisturbed H i morphology with a full extent of 23' 
× 16' at the 5 × 10<SUP>18</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP> 
level. The velocity field of AGC198606 shows ordered motion with a 
gradient of ~25 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> across ~20'. The global velocity 
dispersion is 9.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with no evidence for a narrow 
spectral component. No optical counterpart to AGC198606 is detected. The 
distance to AGC198606 is unknown, and we consider several different 
scenarios: physical association with Leo T, a minihalo at a distance of 
~150 kpc based on the models of Faerman et al. (2013, ApJ, 777, 119), 
and a cloud in the Galactic halo. At a distance of 420 kpc, AGC198606 
would have an H i mass of 6.2 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, 
an H i radius of 1.4 kpc, and a dynamical mass within the H i extent of 
1.5 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

                               Abstract
Strongly gravitationally lensed quasar-galaxy systems allow us to 
compare competing cosmologies as long as one can be reasonably sure of 
the mass distribution within the intervening lens. In this paper, we 
assemble a catalog of 69 such systems from the Sloan Lens ACS and Lens 
Structure and Dynamics surveys suitable for this analysis, and carry out 
a one-on-one comparison between the standard model, ΛCDM, and the 
{{R}<SUB>h</SUB>}=ct universe, which has thus far been favored by the 
application of model selection tools to other kinds of data. We find 
that both models account for the lens observations quite well, though 
the precision of these measurements does not appear to be good enough to 
favor one model over the other. Part of the reason is the so-called 
bulge-halo conspiracy that, on average, results in a baryonic velocity 
dispersion within a fraction of the optical effective radius virtually 
identical to that expected for the whole luminous-dark matter 
distribution modeled as a singular isothermal ellipsoid, though with 
some scatter among individual sources. Future work can greatly improve 
the precision of these measurements by focusing on lensing systems with 
galaxies as close as possible to the background sources. Given the 
limitations of doing precision cosmological testing using the current 
sample, we also carry out Monte Carlo simulations based on the current 
lens measurements to estimate how large the source catalog would have to 
be in order to rule out either model at a ˜ 99.7% confidence 
level. We find that if the real cosmology is ΛCDM, a sample of 
˜ 200 strong gravitational lenses would be sufficient to rule out 
{{R}<SUB>h</SUB>}=ct at this level of accuracy, while ˜ 300 strong 
gravitational lenses would be required to rule out ΛCDM if the 
real universe were instead {{R}<SUB>h</SUB>}=ct. The difference in 
required sample size reflects the greater number of free parameters 
available to fit the data with ΛCDM. We point out that, should 
the {{R}<SUB>h</SUB>}=ct universe eventually emerge as the correct 
cosmology, its lack of any free parameters for this kind of work will 
provide a remarkably powerful probe of the mass structure in lensing 
galaxies, and a means of better understanding the origin of the 
bulge-halo conspiracy.

                               Abstract
We present a numerical study of dark matter halo concentrations in 
ΛCDM and self-similar cosmologies. We show that the relation 
between concentration, c, and peak height, ν, exhibits the smallest 
deviations from universality if halo masses are defined with respect to 
the critical density of the universe. These deviations can be explained 
by the residual dependence of concentration on the local slope of the 
matter power spectrum, n, which affects both the normalization and shape 
of the c-ν relation. In particular, there is no well-defined floor in 
the concentration values. Instead, the minimum concentration depends on 
redshift: at fixed ν, halos at higher z experience steeper slopes n, 
and thus have lower minimum concentrations. We show that the 
concentrations in our simulations can be accurately described by a 
universal seven-parameter function of only ν and n. This model 
matches our ΛCDM results to <~ 5% accuracy up to z = 6, and 
matches scale-free Ω<SUB>m</SUB> = 1 models to <~ 15%. The 
model also reproduces the low concentration values of Earth-mass halos 
at z ≈ 30, and thus correctly extrapolates over 16 orders of 
magnitude in halo mass. The predictions of our model differ 
significantly from all models previously proposed in the literature at 
high masses and redshifts. Our model is in excellent agreement with 
recent lensing measurements of cluster concentrations.

                               Abstract
We review most dynamical constraints on the gravitational field of 
spiral galaxies in general, and of the Milky Way in particular. Such 
constraints are of prime importance for determining the characteristics 
of the putative dark matter haloes of galaxies. For the Milky Way, we 
review observational constraints in the inner parts (cored or cusped 
dark matter distribution, maximum disk or not), in the solar 
neighbourhood (local dark matter density) and in the outer parts (virial 
mass and triaxial shape of the dark matter halo). We also point out 
various caveats, systematic effects, and large current uncertainties. 
Many fundamental parameters such as the local circular velocity are 
poorly known, evidence for triaxiality of the dark halo is shaky, and 
different estimates of the virial mass as well as of the local dark 
matter density vary by at least a factor of two. We however argue that 
the current best-fit value for the local dark matter density, which 
should be used as a benchmark for direct dark matter detection searches, 
is of the order of 0.5 GeV/cm3. We also explain why alternatives to 
particle dark matter on galactic scales should still be very seriously 
considered.

                               Abstract
Recent studies found the densities of dark matter (DM) subhaloes which 
surround nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) to be significantly 
lower than those of the most massive subhaloes expected around Milky 
Way-sized galaxies in cosmological simulations, the so-called 
too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. A caveat of previous work has been that 
dark substructures were assumed to contain steep density cusps in the 
centre of DM haloes even though the central density structure of DM 
haloes is still under debate. In this study, we re-examine the TBTF 
problem for models of DM density structure with cores or shallowed 
cusps. Our analysis demonstrates that the TBTF problem is alleviated as 
the logarithmic slope of the central cusp becomes shallower. We find 
that the TBTF problem is avoided if the central cusps of DM haloes 
surrounding dSphs are shallower than r<SUP>-0.6</SUP>.

                               Abstract
We use the Arecibo legacy fast ALFA (ALFALFA) 21 cm survey to measure 
the number density of galaxies as a function of their rotational 
velocity, V<SUB>rot,HI</SUB> (as inferred from the width of their 21 cm 
emission line). Based on the measured velocity function we statistically 
connect galaxies with their host halo, via abundance matching. In a 
lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, dwarf galaxies are 
expected to be hosted by halos that are significantly more massive than 
indicated by the measured galactic velocity; if smaller halos were 
allowed to host galaxies, then ALFALFA would measure a much higher 
galactic number density. We then seek observational verification of this 
predicted trend by analyzing the kinematics of a literature sample of 
gas-rich dwarf galaxies. We find that galaxies with 
V<SUB>rot,HI</SUB>≲ 25 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> are kinematically 
incompatible with their predicted ΛCDM host halos, in the sense 
that hosts are too massive to be accommodated within the measured 
galactic rotation curves. This issue is analogous to the "too big to 
fail" problem faced by the bright satellites of the Milky Way, but here 
it concerns extreme dwarf galaxies in the field. Consequently, solutions 
based on satellite-specific processes are not applicable in this 
context. Our result confirms the findings of previous studies based on 
optical survey data and addresses a number of observational systematics 
present in these works. Furthermore, we point out the assumptions and 
uncertainties that could strongly affect our conclusions. We show that 
the two most important among them - namely baryonic effects on the 
abundances of halos and on the rotation curves of halos - do not seem 
capable of resolving the reported discrepancy.

                               Abstract
We search for vast planes of satellites (VPoS) in a high-resolution 
simulation of the Local Group performed by the CLUES project, which 
improves significantly the resolution of previous similar studies. We 
use a simple method for detecting planar configurations of satellites, 
and validate it on the known plane of M31. We implement a range of 
prescriptions for modeling the satellite populations, roughly 
reproducing the variety of recipes used in the literature, and 
investigate the occurrence and properties of planar structures in these 
populations. The structure of the simulated satellite systems is 
strongly non-random and contains planes of satellites, predominantly 
co-rotating, with, in some cases, sizes comparable to the plane observed 
in M31 by Ibata et al. However, the latter is slightly richer in 
satellites, slightly thinner, and has stronger co-rotation, which makes 
it stand out as overall more exceptional than the simulated planes, when 
compared to a random population. Although the simulated planes we find 
are generally dominated by one real structure forming its backbone, they 
are also partly fortuitous and are thus not kinematically coherent 
structures as a whole. Provided that the simulated and observed planes 
of satellites are indeed of the same nature, our results suggest that 
the VPoS of M31 is not a coherent disk and that one-third to one-half of 
its satellites must have large proper motions perpendicular to the 
plane.

                               Abstract
The concordance model of cosmology, LCDM, provides a satisfactory 
description of the evolution of the universe and the growth of large 
scale structure. Despite considerable effort, this model does not at 
present provide a satisfactory description of small scale structure and 
the dynamics of bound objects like individual galaxies. In contrast, 
MOND provides a unique and predictively successful description of galaxy 
dynamics, but is mute on the subject of cosmology. Here I briefly review 
these contradictory world views, emphasizing the wealth of distinct, 
interlocking lines of evidence that went into the development of LCDM 
while highlighting the practical impossibility that it can provide a 
satisfactory explanation of the observed MOND phenomenology in galaxy 
dynamics. I also briefly review the baryon budget in groups and clusters 
of galaxies where neither paradigm provides an entirely satisfactory 
description of the data. Relatively little effort has been devoted to 
the formation of structure in MOND; I review some of what has been done. 
The amplitude ratio of the first to second peak in the CMB power 
spectrum was correctly predicted a priori, but the third peak is more 
natural to LCDM. MOND anticipates that structure forms more quickly than 
in LCDM. This motivated the prediction that reionization would happen 
earlier in MOND than originally expected in LCDM, as subsequently 
observed. This also provides a natural explanation for massive, early 
clusters of galaxies and large, empty voids. However, it is far from 
obvious that the mass spectrum of galaxy clusters or the power spectrum 
of galaxies can be explained in MOND, two things that LCDM does well. 
Critical outstanding issues are the development of an acceptable 
relativistic parent theory for MOND, and the reality of the non-baryonic 
dark matter of LCDM. Do suitable dark matter particles exist, or are 
they a modern aether?

                               Abstract
Discrepancies between the observed and model-predicted radio flux ratios 
are seen in a number of quadruply-lensed quasars. The most favoured 
interpretation of these anomalies is that cold dark matter (CDM) 
substructures present in lensing galaxies perturb the lens potentials 
and alter image magnifications and thus flux ratios. So far no consensus 
has emerged regarding whether or not the predicted CDM substructure 
abundance fully accounts for the lensing flux anomaly observations. 
Accurate modelling relies on a realistic lens sample in terms of both 
the lens environment and internal structures and substructures. In this 
paper, we construct samples of generalized and specific lens potentials, 
to which we add (rescaled) subhalo populations from the galaxy-scale 
Aquarius and the cluster-scale Phoenix simulation suites. We further 
investigate the lensing effects from subhaloes of masses several orders 
of magnitude below the simulation resolution limit. The resulting 
flux-ratio distributions are compared to the currently best available 
sample of radio lenses. The observed anomalies in B0128+437, B0712+472 
and B1555+375 are more likely to be caused by propagation effects or 
oversimplified/improper lens modelling, signs of which are already seen 
in the data. Among the quadruple systems that have closely located image 
triplets/pairs, the anomalous flux ratios of MG0414+0534 can be 
reproduced by adding CDM subhaloes to its macroscopic lens potential, 
with a probability of 5-20 per cent; for B0712+472, B1422+231, B1555+375 
and B2045+265, these probabilities are only of a few per cent. We hence 
find that CDM substructures are unlikely to be the whole reason for 
radio flux anomalies. We discuss other possible effects that might also 
be at work.

                               Abstract
We use high-resolution Hydro+N-Body cosmological simulations to compare 
the assembly and evolution of a small field dwarf (stellar mass 
˜10<SUP>6-7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, total mass 10<SUP>10</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) in Λ-dominated cold dark matter (CDM) and 2 
keV warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies. We find that star formation (SF) 
in the WDM model is reduced and delayed by 1-2 Gyr relative to the CDM 
model, independently of the details of SF and feedback. Independent of 
the dark matter (DM) model, but proportionally to the SF efficiency, gas 
outflows lower the central mass density through `dynamical heating', 
such that all realizations have circular velocities <20 km 
s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 500 pc, in agreement with local kinematic constraints. 
As a result of dynamical heating, older stars are less centrally 
concentrated than younger stars, similar to stellar population gradients 
observed in nearby dwarf galaxies. Introducing an important diagnostic 
of SF and feedback models, we translate our simulations into artificial 
colour-magnitude diagrams and star formation histories (SFHs) in order 
to directly compare to available observations. The simulated galaxies 
formed most of their stars in many ˜10 Myr long bursts. The CDM 
galaxy has a global SFH, H I abundance and Fe/H and alpha-elements 
distribution well matched to current observations of dwarf galaxies. 
These results highlight the importance of directly including `baryon 
physics' in simulations when (1) comparing predictions of galaxy 
formation models with the kinematics and number density of local dwarf 
galaxies and (2) differentiating between CDM and non-standard models 
with different DM or power spectra.

                               Abstract
Big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest 
nuclides via a dynamic interplay among the four fundamental forces 
during the first seconds of cosmic time. We briefly overview the 
essentials of this physics, and present new calculations of light 
element abundances through li6 and li7, with updated nuclear reactions 
and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime. We provide 
fits to these results as a function of baryon density and of the number 
of neutrino flavors, N_nu. We review recent developments in BBN, 
particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) 
measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium content, and the 
effective number of degrees of freedom, n_eff. These measurements allow 
for a tight test of BBN and of cosmology using CMB data alone. Our 
likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our BBN 
output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light 
elements strengthens the power of BBN. We include a new determination of 
the primordial helium abundance in our likelihood analysis. New D/H 
observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical 
predictions, and are consistent with the Standard Model and the Planck 
baryon density. Moreover, D/H now provides a tight measurement of N_nu 
when combined with the CMB baryon density, and provides a 2sigma upper 
limit N_nu < 3.2. The new precision of the CMB and of D/H 
observations together leave D/H predictions as the largest source of 
uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore 
rely on improved nuclear cross section data. In contrast with D/H and 
he4, li7 predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps 
pointing to new physics.

                               Abstract
Among the 25 planetary systems detected up to now by gravitational 
microlensing, there are two cases of a star with two planets, and two 
cases of a binary star with a planet. Other, yet undetected types of 
triple lenses include triple stars or stars with a planet with a moon. 
The analysis and interpretation of such events is hindered by the lack 
of understanding of essential characteristics of triple lenses, such as 
their critical curves and caustics. We present here analytical and 
numerical methods for mapping the critical-curve topology and caustic 
cusp number in the parameter space of n-point-mass lenses. We apply the 
methods to the analysis of four symmetric triple-lens models, and obtain 
altogether 9 different critical-curve topologies and 32 caustic 
structures. While these results include various generic types, they 
represent just a subset of all possible triple-lens critical curves and 
caustics. Using the analyzed models, we demonstrate interesting features 
of triple lenses that do not occur in two-point-mass lenses. We show an 
example of a lens that cannot be described by the Chang-Refsdal 
model in the wide limit. In the close limit we demonstrate unusual 
structures of primary and secondary caustic loops, and explain the 
conditions for their occurrence. In the planetary limit we find that the 
presence of a planet may lead to a whole sequence of additional caustic 
metamorphoses. We show that a pair of planets may change the structure 
of the primary caustic even when placed far from their resonant position 
at the Einstein radius.

                               Abstract
We measure the angular clustering of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 in order to probe the spatial distribution 
of satellite galaxies within their dark matter halos. Specifically, we 
measure the angular correlation function on very small scales 
(7″-320″) in a range of luminosity threshold samples 
(absolute r-band magnitudes from -18 up to -21) that are 
constructed from the subset of SDSS that has been spectroscopically 
observed more than once (the so-called plate overlap region). We choose 
to measure angular clustering in this reduced survey footprint in order 
to minimize the effects of fiber collision incompleteness, which are 
otherwise substantial on these small scales, and we discuss the possible 
impact that fiber collisions have on our measurements. We model our 
clustering measurements using a fully numerical halo model that 
populates dark matter halos in N-body simulations to create realistic 
mock galaxy catalogs. The model has free parameters that specify both 
the number and spatial distribution of galaxies within their host halos. 
We adopt a flexible density profile for the spatial distribution of 
satellite galaxies that is similar to the dark matter 
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, except that the inner 
slope is allowed to vary. We find that the angular clustering of our 
most luminous samples ({{M}<SUB>r</SUB>} < -20 and -21) 
suggests that luminous satellite galaxies have substantially steeper 
inner density profiles than NFW. Lower-luminosity samples are less 
constraining, however, and are consistent with satellite galaxies having 
shallow density profiles. Our results confirm the findings of Watson et 
al. while using different clustering measurements and modeling 
methodology.

We study how halo intrinsic dynamical properties are linked to their 
formation processes for halos in two mass ranges, 
{10}<SUP>12</SUP>-{10}<SUP>12.5</SUP> {h}<SUP>-1</SUP>{M}<SUB>⊙ 
</SUB> and ≥slant {10}<SUP>13</SUP> {h}<SUP>-1</SUP>{M}<SUB>⊙ 
</SUB>, and how both are correlated with the large-scale tidal field 
within which the halos reside at present. We identify infall halos that 
are about to merge with their hosts. We find that the tangential infall 
velocity increases significantly with the strength of the tidal field, 
but no strong correlation is found for the radial component. These 
results can be used to explain the environmental dependence of internal 
velocity anisotropy and spin of halos. The position vectors and 
velocities of infall halos are aligned with the principal axes of the 
tidal field, and the alignment depends on the strength of the tidal 
field. Opposite accretion patterns are found in weak and strong tidal 
fields, showing that in a weak field the accretion flow is dominated by 
radial motion within the local structure, while a large tangential 
component is present in a strong field. These findings can be used to 
understand the strong alignments we find between the principal axes of 
the internal velocity ellipsoids of halos and the tidal field, and their 
dependence on the strength of the tidal field. We further find that only 
in weak tidal fields does the spin-tidal field alignment follow the 
prediction of the tidal torque theory. We discuss how our results may be 
used to understand the spins of disk galaxies and velocity structures of 
elliptical galaxies and their correlations with large-scale structure.

                               Abstract
Observed kinematical data of 40 Local Group (LG) members are used to 
derive the dark matter halo mass of such galaxies. Haloes are selected 
from the theoretically expected LG mass function and two different 
density profiles are assumed, a standard universal cuspy model and a 
mass-dependent profile which accounts for the effects of baryons in 
modifying the dark matter distribution within galaxies. The resulting 
relations between stellar and halo mass are compared with expectations 
from abundance matching. Using a universal cuspy profile, the ensemble 
of LG galaxies is fit in relatively low-mass haloes, leaving `dark' many 
massive haloes of M<SUB>halo</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>10</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB>: this reflects the `too-big-to-fail' problem and 
results in a M<SUB>star</SUB>-M<SUB>halo</SUB> relation that differs 
from abundance matching predictions. Moreover, the star formation 
efficiency of isolated LG galaxies increases with decreasing halo mass 
when adopting a cuspy model. By contrast, using the mass-dependent 
density profile, dwarf galaxies with M<SUB>star</SUB> ≳ 
10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> are assigned to more massive haloes, 
which have a central cored distribution of dark matter: the 
`too-big-to-fail' problem is alleviated, the resultant 
M<SUB>star</SUB>-M<SUB>halo</SUB> relation follows abundance matching 
predictions down to the completeness limit of current surveys, and the 
star formation efficiency of isolated members decreases with decreasing 
halo mass, in agreement with theoretical expectations. Finally, the 
cusp/core space of LG galaxies is presented, providing a framework to 
understand the non-universality of their density profiles.

                               Abstract
The structure and dark matter halo core properties of dwarf spheroidal 
galaxies (dSphs) are investigated. A double-isothermal (DIS) model of an 
isothermal, non-self-gravitating stellar system embedded in an 
isothermal dark halo core provides an excellent fit to the various 
observed stellar surface density distributions. The stellar core scale 
length a<SUB>*</SUB> is sensitive to the central dark matter density 
ρ<SUB>0,d</SUB>. The maximum stellar radius traces the dark halo 
core radius {r}<SUB>c,d</SUB>. The concentration c<SUB>*</SUB> of the 
stellar system, determined by a King profile fit, depends on the ratio 
of the stellar-to-dark-matter velocity dispersion {σ 
}<SUB>*</SUB>/{σ }<SUB>d</SUB>. Simple empirical relationships are 
derived that allow us to calculate the dark halo core parameters 
ρ<SUB>0,d</SUB>, {r}<SUB>c,d</SUB>, and σ<SUB>d</SUB> given 
the observable stellar quantities σ<SUB>*</SUB>, a<SUB>*</SUB>, 
and c<SUB>*</SUB>. The DIS model is applied to the Milky Way’s 
dSphs. All dSphs closely follow the same universal dark halo scaling 
relations {ρ }<SUB>0,d</SUB>× 
{r}<SUB>c,d</SUB>={75}<SUB>-45</SUB><SUP>+85</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> 
pc<SUP>-2</SUP> that characterize the cores of more massive 
galaxies over a large range in masses. The dark halo core mass is a 
strong function of core radius, {M}<SUB>c,d</SUB>˜ 
{r}<SUB>c,d</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>. Inside a fixed radius of ˜400 pc the 
total dark matter mass is, however, roughly constant with 
{M}<SUB>d</SUB>=2.6+/- 1.4× {10}<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, 
although outliers are expected. The dark halo core densities of the 
Galaxy’s dSphs are very high, with {ρ }<SUB>0,d</SUB> ≈  
0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-3</SUP>. dSphs should therefore be 
tidally undisturbed. Evidence for tidal effects might then provide a 
serious challenge for the CDM scenario.

                               Abstract
We use high resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies to study 
the physics of dark matter cusp-core transformation at the edge of 
galaxy formation (Mvir = 10^7 - 10^9 Msun). We work at a resolution (4 
pc) at which the impact from individual supernovae explosions can be 
resolved, becoming insensitive to even large changes in our numerical 
'sub-grid' parameters. We find that our dwarf galaxies give a remarkable 
match to the stellar light profile; star formation history; metallicity 
distribution function; and star/gas kinematics of isolated dwarf 
irregular galaxies. Our key result is that dark matter cores of size 
comparable to the half light radius r_1/2 always form if star formation 
proceeds for long enough. Cores fully form in less than 4 Gyrs for the 
Mvir =10^8 Msun and 14 Gyrs for the 10^9 Msun dwarf. We provide a 
convenient two parameter 'coreNFW' fitting function that captures this 
dark matter core growth as a function of star formation time and the 
projected half light radius. Our results have several important 
implications: (i) we make a strong prediction that if LambdaCDM is 
correct, then 'pristine' dark matter cusps will be found either in 
systems that have truncated star formation and/or at radii r > r_1/2; 
(ii) complete core formation lowers the projected velocity dispersion at 
r_1/2 by a factor ~2, which is sufficient to fully explain the 'too big 
to fail problem' (though we stress that a full solution likely also 
involves unmodelled environmental effects); and (iii) cored dwarfs will 
be much more susceptible to tides, leading to a dramatic scouring of the 
subhalo mass function inside galaxies and groups. We will explore such 
environmental effects in a forthcoming paper.

                               Abstract
The standard paradigm of structure formation in the universe, the cold 
dark matter (CDM) cosmology, contains several crucial unsolved problems. 
Recent observation of nearby dwarf galaxies has revealed that the 
density profile of dark matter (DM) halo is constant at the center of 
these galaxies. However, cosmological N-body simulations always show 
steep power-law mass-density distribution at their centers. This 
discrepancy is a well-known unresolved problem in the CDM model, and 
so-called the ``cusp-core problem''. In addition, "too-big-to-fail 
problem" is another issue. Recent observations of nearby dwarf 
spheroidal galaxies show that the masses of dark matter subhaloes in 
observed galaxies is significantly lower than those of the most massive 
subhaloes expected around Milky Way sized galaxies.To solve these 
problems, we study about the dynamical response of a virialized system 
with a central cusp to the energy feedback driven by supernova 
explosions using collisionless N-body simulations by the 
Nested-Particle-Mesh code. The galactic wind driven by supernova 
feedbacks loses energy by radiative cooling, and then falls back toward 
the galactic center. Subsequently, the starburst is enhanced again. This 
cycle of expansion and contraction of the interstellar gas leads to a 
recursive change in the gravitational potential. The resonance between 
DM particles and the density wave excited by the oscillating potential 
plays a significant role in the cusp-core transition of DM halos. 
Furthermore, we show that the cusp-core transition with the periodic 
supernova feedback solves the too-big-to-fail problem.

                               Abstract
We investigate the internal structure and density profiles of haloes of 
mass 10<SUP>10</SUP>-10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in the Evolution 
and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environment (EAGLE) simulations. 
These follow the formation of galaxies in a Λ cold dark matter 
Universe and include a treatment of the baryon physics thought to be 
relevant. The EAGLE simulations reproduce the observed present-day 
galaxy stellar mass function, as well as many other properties of the 
galaxy population as a function of time. We find significant differences 
between the masses of haloes in the EAGLE simulations and in simulations 
that follow only the dark matter component. Nevertheless, haloes are 
well described by the Navarro-Frenk-White density profile at radii 
larger than ˜5 per cent of the virial radius but, closer to the 
centre, the presence of stars can produce cuspier profiles. Central 
enhancements in the total mass profile are most important in haloes of 
mass 10<SUP>12</SUP>-10<SUP>13</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, where the 
stellar fraction peaks. Over the radial range where they are well 
resolved, the resulting galaxy rotation curves are in very good 
agreement with observational data for galaxies with stellar mass 
M<SUB>*</SUB> < 5 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We 
present an empirical fitting function that describes the total mass 
profiles and show that its parameters are strongly correlated with halo 
mass.

                               Abstract
One of the major challenges of modern physics is to decipher the nature 
of dark matter. Astrophysical observations provide ample evidence for 
the existence of an invisible and dominant mass component in the 
observable universe, from the scales of galaxies up to the largest 
cosmological scales. The dark matter could be made of new, yet 
undiscovered elementary particles, with allowed masses and interaction 
strengths with normal matter spanning an enormous range. Axions, 
produced non-thermally in the early universe, and weakly interacting 
massive particles (WIMPs), which froze out of thermal equilibrium with a 
relic density matching the observations, represent two well-motivated, 
generic classes of dark matter candidates. Dark matter axions could be 
detected by exploiting their predicted coupling to two photons, where 
the highest sensitivity is reached by experiments using a microwave 
cavity permeated by a strong magnetic field. WIMPs could be directly 
observed via scatters off atomic nuclei in underground, ultra 
low-background detectors, or indirectly, via secondary radiation 
produced when they pair annihilate. They could also be generated at 
particle colliders such as the LHC, where associated particles produced 
in the same process are to be detected. After a brief motivation and an 
introduction to the phenomenology of particle dark matter detection, I 
will discuss the most promising experimental techniques to search for 
axions and WIMPs, addressing their current and future science reach, as 
well as their complementarity.

                               Abstract
We use measurements from the Planck satellite mission and galaxy 
redshift surveys over the last decade to test three of the basic 
assumptions of the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM: the 
spatial curvature of the universe, the nature of dark energy and the 
laws of gravity on large scales. We obtain improved constraints on 
several scenarios that violate one or more of these assumptions. We 
measure $w_0=-0.94\pm0.17$ (18\% measurement) and $1+w_a=1.16\pm0.36$ 
(31\% measurement) for models with a time-dependent equation of state, 
which is an improvement over current best constraints 
\citep{Aubourg2014}. In the context of modified gravity, we consider 
popular scalar tensor models as well as a parametrization of the growth 
factor. In the case of one-parameter $f(R)$ gravity models with a 
$\Lambda$CDM background, we constrain $B_0 < 1.36 \times 10^{-5} $ 
(1$\sigma$ C.L.), which is an improvement by a factor of 4 on the 
current best \citep{XU2015}. We provide the very first constraint on the 
coupling parameters of general scalar-tensor theory and stringent 
constraint on the only free coupling parameter of Chameleon models. We 
also derive constraints on extended Chameleon models, improving the 
constraint on the coupling by a factor of 6 on the current best 
\citep{Hojjati2011} . We also measure $\gamma = 0.612 \pm 0.072$ (11.7\% 
measurement) for growth index parametrization. We improve all the 
current constraints by combining results from various galaxy redshift 
surveys in a coherent way, which includes a careful treatment of 
scale-dependence introduced by modified gravity.

                               Abstract
We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to consistently compare the 
assembly of dwarf galaxies in both Λ dominated, cold dark matter 
(CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models. The SIDM model 
adopts a constant cross-section of 2 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>, a 
relatively large value to maximize its effects. These are the first SIDM 
simulations that are combined with a description of stellar feedback 
that naturally drives potential fluctuations able to create dark matter 
(DM) cores. Remarkably, SIDM fails to significantly lower the central DM 
density within the central 500 pc at halo peak velocities 
V<SUB>max</SUB> < 30 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This is due to the fact that 
the central regions of very low mass field haloes have relatively low 
central velocity dispersion and densities, leading to time-scales for 
SIDM collisions greater than a Hubble time. CDM haloes with 
V<SUB>max</SUB> < 30 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> have inefficient star 
formation, and hence weak supernova feedback. At a fixed 2 
cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP> SIDM cross-section, the DM content of very 
low mass CDM and SIDM haloes differs by no more than a factor of 2 
within 100-200 pc. At larger halo masses (˜10<SUP>10</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), the introduction of baryonic processes creates field 
dwarf galaxies with DM cores and central DM+baryon distributions that 
are effectively indistinguishable between CDM and SIDM. Both models are 
in broad agreement with observed Local Group field galaxies across the 
range of masses explored. To significantly differentiate SIDM from CDM 
at the scale of faint dwarf galaxies, a velocity-dependent cross-section 
that rapidly increases to values larger than 2 cm<SUP>2</SUP> 
g<SUP>-1</SUP> for haloes with V<SUB>max</SUB> < 25-30 km 
s<SUP>-1</SUP> needs to be introduced.

                               Abstract
We perform a study of the nonlinear clustering of matter in the 
late-forming dark matter (LFDM) scenario in which dark matter results 
from the transition of a nonminimally coupled scalar field from 
radiation to collisionless matter. A distinct feature of this model is 
the presence of a damped oscillatory cutoff in the linear matter power 
spectrum at small scales. We use a suite of high-resolution N-body 
simulations to study the imprints of LFDM on the nonlinear matter power 
spectrum, the halo mass and velocity functions and the halo density 
profiles. The model largely satisfies high-redshift matter power 
spectrum constraints from Lyman-α forest measurements, while it 
predicts suppressed abundance of low-mass halos (˜10<SUP>9</SUP>- 
10<SUP>10</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ) at all redshifts 
compared to a vanilla Λ CDM model. The analysis of the LFDM halo 
velocity function shows a better agreement than the Λ CDM 
prediction with the observed abundance of low-velocity galaxies in the 
local volume. Halos with mass M ≳10<SUP>11</SUP> h<SUP>-1</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB> show minor departures of the density profiles from 
Λ CDM expectations, while smaller-mass halos are less dense, 
consistent with the fact that they form later than their Λ CDM 
counterparts.

                               Abstract
We use a complete and rigorous statistical indicator to measure the 
level of concordance between cosmological data sets, without relying on 
the inspection of the marginal posterior distribution of some selected 
parameters. We apply this test to state of the art cosmological data 
sets, to assess their agreement within the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find 
that there is a good level of concordance between all the experiments 
with one noticeable exception. There is substantial evidence of tension 
between the CMB, temperature and polarization, measurements of the 
Planck satellite and the data from the CFHTLenS weak lensing survey even 
when applying ultra conservative cuts. These results robustly point 
toward the possibility of having unaccounted systematic effects in the 
data, an incomplete modelling of the cosmological predictions or hints 
toward new physical phenomena.

overcome two long-standing problems of the standard cosmological model 
on galaxy scales: (i) the problem of satellite planes around Local Group 
galaxies, and (ii) the "too big to fail" problem. By comparing 
dissipational and dissipationless simulations, we find no indication 
that the addition of baryonic physics results in more flattened 
satellite distributions around Milky-Way-like systems. Recent claims to 
the contrary are shown to derive in part from a non-standard metric for 
the degree of flattening, which ignores the satellites' radial 
positions. If the full 3D positions of the satellite galaxies are 
considered, none of the simulations we analyse reproduce the observed 
flattening nor the observed degree of kinematic coherence of the Milky 
Way satellite system. Our results are consistent with the expectation 
that baryonic physics should have little or no influence on the 
structure of satellite systems on scales of hundreds of kiloparsecs. 
Claims that the "too big to fail" problem can be resolved by the 
addition of baryonic physics are also shown to be problematic.

                               Abstract
We investigate the effect of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) on the 
density profiles of V<SUB>max</SUB> ≃ 40km s<SUP>-1</SUP> isolated 
dwarf dark matter haloes - the scale of relevance for the too big to 
fail problem (TBTF) - using very high resolution cosmological zoom 
simulations. Each halo has millions of particles within its virial 
radius. We find that SIDM models with cross-sections per unit mass 
spanning the range σ/m = 0.5-50 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP> 
alleviate TBTF and produce constant-density cores of size 300-1000 pc, 
comparable to the half-light radii of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ˜ 
10<SUP>5 - 7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> dwarfs. The largest, lowest density 
cores develop for cross-sections in the middle of this range, σ/m 
˜ 5-10 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our largest SIDM 
cross-section run (σ/m = 50 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>) 
develops a slightly denser core owing to mild core-collapse behaviour, 
but it remains less dense than the cold dark matter case and retains a 
constant-density core profile. Our work suggests that SIDM 
cross-sections as large or larger than 50 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP> 
remain viable on velocity scales of dwarf galaxies (v<SUB>rms</SUB> 
˜ 40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The range of SIDM cross-sections that 
alleviate TBTF and the cusp/core problem spans at least two orders of 
magnitude and therefore need not be particularly fine-tuned.

                               Abstract
We report the discovery of 158 previously undetected dwarf galaxies in 
the Fornax cluster central regions using a deep coadded u-, g-, and 
i-band image obtained with the Dark Energy Camera wide-field camera 
mounted on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican 
Observatory as part of the Next Generation Fornax Survey (NGFS). The new 
dwarf galaxies have quasi-exponential light profiles, effective radii 
0.1 < r<SUB>e</SUB> < 2.8 kpc, and average effective surface 
brightness values 22.0 < μ<SUB>i</SUB> < 28.0 mag 
arcsec<SUP>‑2</SUP>. We confirm the existence of ultra-diffuse 
galaxies (UDGs) in the Fornax core regions that resemble counterparts 
recently discovered in the Virgo and Coma galaxy clusters. We also find 
extremely low surface brightness NGFS dwarfs, which are several 
magnitudes fainter than the classical UDGs. The faintest dwarf candidate 
in our NGFS sample has an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>i</SUB> = 
‑8.0 mag. The nucleation fraction of the NGFS dwarf galaxy sample 
appears to decrease as a function of their total luminosity, reaching 
from a nucleation fraction of >75% at luminosities brighter than 
M<SUB>i</SUB> ≃ ‑15.0 mag to 0% at luminosities fainter than 
M<SUB>i</SUB> ≃ ‑10.0 mag. The two-point correlation function 
analysis of the NGFS dwarf sample shows an excess on length scales below 
∼100 kpc, pointing to the clustering of dwarf galaxies in the Fornax 
cluster core.

                               Abstract
Context: We introduce the Dwarf Galaxy Survey with Amateur Telescopes 
(DGSAT) project and report the discovery of eleven Low Surface 
Brightness (LSB) galaxies in the fields of the nearby galaxies NGC 2683, 
NGC 3628, NGC 4594 (M104), NGC 4631, NGC 5457 (M101), and NGC7814. Aims: 
The DGSAT project aims at using the potential of small-sized telescopes 
to probe LSB features around large galaxies and to increase the sample 
size of the dwarf satellite galaxies in the Local Volume. Methods: Using 
long exposure images centred on the target, its field is explored for 
extended low surface brightness objects. After identifying dwarf galaxy 
candidates, their observed properties are extracted by fitting models to 
their light profiles. Results: We find three, one, three, one, one, and 
two new LSB galaxies in the fields of NGC 2683, 3628, 4594, 4631, 5457, 
and 7814, respectively. In addition to the newly found galaxies, we 
analyse the structural properties of 9 already known galaxies. All of 
these 20 dwarf galaxy candidates have effective surface brightnesses in 
the range $25.3\lesssim\mu_{e}\lesssim28.8$ mag.arcsec$^{-2}$ and are 
fit with Sersic profiles with indices $n\lesssim 1$. Assuming that they 
are in the vicinity of the above mentioned massive galaxies, their 
$r$-band absolute magnitudes, their effective radii, and their 
luminosities are in the ranges $-15.6 \lesssim M_r \lesssim -7.8$, $160$ 
pc $\lesssim R_e \lesssim 4.1$ kpc, and $0.1\times 10^6 
\lesssim\left(\frac{L}{L_{\odot}}\right)_r\lesssim127 \times 10^6$, 
respectively. To determine if these LSB galaxies are indeed satellites 
of the above mentioned massive galaxies, their distances need to be 
determined via further observations. Conclusions: Using small telescopes 
we are readily able to detect LSB galaxies with similar properties to 
the known dwarf galaxies of the Local Group.

                               Abstract
We use a semi-analytical model for the substructure of dark matter 
haloes to assess the too big to fail (TBTF) problem. The model 
accurately reproduces the average subhalo mass and velocity functions, 
as well as their halo-to-halo variance, in N-body simulations. We 
construct thousands of realizations of Milky Way (MW)-size host haloes, 
allowing us to investigate the TBTF problem with unprecedented 
statistical power. We examine the dependence on host halo mass and 
cosmology, and explicitly demonstrate that a reliable assessment of TBTF 
requires large samples of hundreds of host haloes. We argue that 
previous statistics used to address TBTF suffer from the look-elsewhere 
effect and/or disregard certain aspects of the data on the MW satellite 
population. We devise a new statistic that is not hampered by these 
shortcomings, and, using only data on the nine known MW satellite 
galaxies with V<SUB>max</SUB> > 15 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, demonstrate 
that 1.4^{+3.3}_{-1.1} per cent of MW-size host haloes have a subhalo 
population in statistical agreement with that of the MW. However, when 
using data on the MW satellite galaxies down to V<SUB>max</SUB> = 8 km 
s<SUP>-1</SUP>, this MW consistent fraction plummets to <5 × 
10<SUP>-4</SUP> (at 68 per cent confidence level). Hence, if it turns 
out that the inventory of MW satellite galaxies is complete down to 8 km 
s<SUP>-1</SUP>, then the maximum circular velocities of MW satellites 
are utterly inconsistent with Λ cold dark matter predictions, 
unless baryonic effects can drastically increase the spread in 
V<SUB>max</SUB> values of satellite galaxies compared to that of their 
subhaloes.

                               Abstract
Using the spectroscopic catalogue of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data 
Release 10, we have explored the abundance of satellites around a sample 
of 254 massive (10<SUP>11</SUP> < M<SUB>⋆</SUB> < 2 × 
10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) local (z < 0.025) galaxies. We 
have divided our sample into four morphological groups (E, S0, Sa, 
Sb/c). We find that the number of satellites with M<SUB>⋆</SUB> 
≳ 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and R < 300 kpc depends 
drastically on the morphology of the central galaxy. The average number 
of satellites per galaxy host (N<SUB>Sat</SUB>/N<SUB>Host</SUB>) down to 
a mass ratio of 1:100 is 4.5 ± 0.3 for E hosts, 2.6 ± 0.2 
for S0, 1.5 ± 0.1 for Sa and 1.2 ± 0.2 for Sb/c. The 
amount of stellar mass enclosed by the satellites around massive E-type 
galaxies is a factor of 2, 4 and 5 larger than the mass in the 
satellites of S0, Sa and Sb/c types, respectively. If these satellites 
would eventually infall into the host galaxies, for all the 
morphological types, the merger channel will be largely dominated by 
satellites with a mass ratio satellite-host μ > 0.1. The fact that 
massive elliptical galaxies have a significant larger number of 
satellites than massive spirals could point out that elliptical galaxies 
inhabit heavier dark matter haloes than equally massive galaxies with 
later morphological types. If this hypothesis is correct, the dark 
matter haloes of late-type spiral galaxies are a factor of ˜2-3 
more efficient on producing galaxies with the same stellar mass than 
those dark matter haloes of early-type galaxies.

                               Abstract
We study how optical galaxy morphology depends on mass and star 
formation rate (SFR) in the Illustris Simulation. To do so, we measure 
automated galaxy structures in 10 808 simulated galaxies at z = 0 with 
stellar masses 10<SUP>9.7</SUP> < M<SUB>*</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> 
< 10<SUP>12.3</SUP>. We add observational realism to idealized 
synthetic images and measure non-parametric statistics in rest-frame 
optical and near-IR images from four directions. We find that Illustris 
creates a morphologically diverse galaxy population, occupying the 
observed bulge strength locus and reproducing median morphology trends 
versus stellar mass, SFR, and compactness. Morphology correlates 
realistically with rotation, following classification schemes put forth 
by kinematic surveys. Type fractions as a function of environment agree 
roughly with data. These results imply that connections among mass, star 
formation, and galaxy structure arise naturally from models matching 
global star formation and halo occupation functions when simulated with 
accurate methods. This raises a question of how to construct experiments 
on galaxy surveys to better distinguish between models. We predict that 
at fixed halo mass near 10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, 
disc-dominated galaxies have higher stellar mass than bulge-dominated 
ones, a possible consequence of the Illustris feedback model. While 
Illustris galaxies at M<SUB>*</SUB> ˜ 10<SUP>11</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB> have a reasonable size distribution, those at 
M<SUB>*</SUB> ˜ 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> have half-light 
radii larger than observed by a factor of 2. Furthermore, at 
M<SUB>*</SUB> ˜ 10<SUP>10.5</SUP>-10<SUP>11</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a relevant fraction of Illustris galaxies have 
distinct `ring-like' features, such that the bright pixels have an 
unusually wide spatial extent.

                               Abstract
We present multiple ultrahigh resolution cosmological hydrodynamic 
simulations of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>4-6.3</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB> dwarf galaxies that form within two M<SUB>vir</SUB> = 
10<SUP>9.5-10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> dark matter halo initial 
conditions. Our simulations rely on the Feedback in Realistic 
Environments (FIRE) implementation of star formation feedback and were 
run with high enough force and mass resolution to directly resolve 
structure on the ˜200 pc scales. The resultant galaxies sit on the 
M<SUB>⋆</SUB> versus M<SUB>vir</SUB> relation required to match the 
Local Group stellar mass function via abundance matching. They have 
bursty star formation histories and also form with half-light radii and 
metallicities that broadly match those observed for local dwarfs at the 
same stellar mass. We demonstrate that it is possible to create a large 
(˜1 kpc) constant-density dark matter core in a cosmological 
simulation of an M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>6.3</SUP> 
M<SUB>⊙</SUB> dwarf galaxy within a typical M<SUB>vir</SUB> = 
10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> halo - precisely the scale of interest 
for resolving the `too big to fail' problem. However, these large cores 
are not ubiquitous and appear to correlate closely with the star 
formation histories of the dwarfs: dark matter cores are largest in 
systems that form their stars late (z ≲ 2), after the early epoch 
of cusp building mergers has ended. Our M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≃ 
10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> dwarf retains a cuspy dark matter halo 
density profile that matches that of a dark-matter-only run of the same 
system. Though ancient, most of the stars in our ultrafaint form after 
reionization; the ultraviolet field acts mainly to suppress fresh gas 
accretion, not to boil away gas that is already present in the 
protodwarf.

                               Abstract
We analyse a set of volume-limited samples from SDSS DR12 to quantify 
the degree of inhomogeneity at different length-scales using Shannon 
entropy. We find that the galaxy distributions exhibit a higher degree 
of inhomogeneity as compared to a Poisson point process at all 
length-scales. Our analysis indicates that signatures of inhomogeneities 
in the galaxy distributions persist at least up to a length-scale of 120 
h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. The galaxy distributions appear to be homogeneous on 
a scale of 140 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc and beyond. Analysing a set of mock 
galaxy samples from a semi-analytic galaxy catalogue from the Millennium 
simulation, we find a scale of transition to homogeneity at ˜100 
h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc.

                               Abstract
We present an analysis of the evolving comoving cumulative number 
density of galaxy populations found in the Illustris simulation. 
Cumulative number density is commonly used to link galaxy populations 
across different epochs by assuming that galaxies preserve their number 
density in time. Our analysis allows us to examine the extent to which 
this assumption holds in the presence of galaxy mergers or when rank 
ordering is broken owing to variable stellar growth rates. Our primary 
results are as follows: (1) the inferred average stellar mass evolution 
obtained via a constant comoving number density assumption is 
systematically biased compared to the merger tree results at the factor 
of ˜2(4) level when tracking galaxies from redshift z = 0 to 2(3); 
(2) the median number density evolution for galaxy populations tracked 
forward in time is shallower than for galaxy populations tracked 
backward; (3) a similar evolution in the median number density of 
tracked galaxy populations is found regardless of whether number density 
is assigned via stellar mass, stellar velocity dispersion, or halo mass; 
(4) explicit tracking reveals a large diversity in the stellar and dark 
matter assembly histories that cannot be captured by constant number 
density analyses; (5) the significant scatter in galaxy linking methods 
is only marginally reduced (˜20 per cent) by considering 
additional physical galaxy properties. We provide fits for the median 
evolution in number density for use with observational data and discuss 
the implications of our analysis for interpreting multi-epoch galaxy 
property observations.
