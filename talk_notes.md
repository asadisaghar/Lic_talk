## LCDM model/CDM/WIMPs (3)
The Cold Dark Matter Model he Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model is currently considered the standard model of cosmology. According to this model, ∼ 95% of the universe is unaccounted for. The energy content of our universe at the current epoch is dominated (∼ 72%) by a cosmological constant, Λ, the nature of which is still a matter of discussion. Moreover, ∼ 23% of the energy density is in the form of dark matter which is made of “cold”, “dark”, and non-baryonic particles. These particles are called “dark”, since they are only detectable through gravitational interactions and interact very weakly with photons and other standard-model particles. “Cold” refers to the fact that the velocities of dark matter particles were non-relativistic at the epoch of decoupling; and they are intrinsically different from the normal (baryonic) matter. The CDM model explains the anisotropies in cosmic microwave background (CMB) as observed by the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (WMAP) in a more convincing way than the alternative forms of DM such as warm or hot DM (Spergel et al., 2007; Komatsu et al., 2009, 2011). Besides, the large-scale structure formation of the universe based upon the ΛCDM model is in agreement with most observational data. The subgalactic-scale predictions of the model, however, have not yet been confirmed observationally. 

### Missing satellite problem (3)
The count of satellite galaxies in the local Universe vastly differs from that of subhalos predicted by CDM simulations. Based on the standard structure formation recipe, the smooth component of massive halos are built up from tidal stripping material from smaller ones. However, as this process occurs over several billion years, many small halos are expected to temporarily survive in the form of subhalos which make up $\sim 10\%$ of the mass of a galaxy-sized halo at z=0 \citep[][]{Gao11, Maciejewski11}. On the other hand, dwarf galaxies are expected to form in low-mass field halos, which would result in a large expected number of satellite galaxies within the dark matter halo of the central galaxy. It is commonly argued that this discrepancy could be explained by including feedback processes suppressing star formation in low-mass halos \citep[][]{Maccio10, Font11} meaning that a large population of substructures with very high mass-to-light ratios in the halos of galaxies has remained undiscovered.

### Too big to fail problem (3)
One naively expects to find the most luminous dwarf galaxies in the most massive subhalos and high-resolution cosmological simulations persistently produce massive subhalos ($M_{vir} \geq 10^{10} M_\odot$) which are too concentrated in their central kpc to host any of the satellite galaxies around the Milky Way or Andromeda \citep[][]{Boylan-Kolchin11}. Some models suggest that these satellilee galaxies correspond to more massive subhalos at higher redshifts. Therefore, the discovery of very massive substructures in the halos of galaxies at higher redshifts could help resolving this concern.

### Cusp/core problem (3)
Standard halos of the CDM model are too concentrated in the center compared to the observed halo parameters of dwarf galaxies. While N-body simulations based upon the CDM theory predict a cuspy dark matter distribution of dark halos with a high central concentration, observations of the rotation curves of galaxies have failed to confirm this in their central regions.

### Plane-of-satellites problem (1)


### Separate issues or fundamental challenge? (2)

## Gravitational lensing (5)
The fact that gravity treats dark and luminous mass the same gives gravitational lensing a unique opportunity to provide an independent test for the presence of halo substructures. Strong lensing by a foreground object can produce multiple images of a background lightsource. Measurements on strong lensing systems provide us with information about mass distribution of both the lens and the source. All different types of massive objects such as galaxies or galaxy clusters can serve as lenses and bend the light from their background. However, in order to study the sub-galactic structure of dark matter we need to look at a particular type of lensing systems which involve a single lens galaxy only. The foreground galaxy produces multiple images of the background light source, which are $\sim1$ arcsec apart. One way to use such systems to probe dark matter on sub-galactic scales is to study the small-scale distortions that halo substructure is expected to introduce in the surface brightness distributions of extended macroimages. 

### Strong lensing/compound lensing
Dark halo substructure inside the halo of a foreground galaxy may reveal itself as secondary, small-scale gravitational lensign effects on light sources that are multiply-lensed by the galaxy. 

### Flux-ratio anomaly/Time delay-Astrometric shift/Surface-brightness disturbance/
__Flux ratio anomalies__ Gravitational lensing is a propagation phenomenon, thus it _in principle_  conserves the number of photons. On the other hand, the gravitational deflection influences the cross section of the light bundle differentially. Consequently, in order to conserve the flux, the area of the image(s) of the source changes. This leads to different magnifications for different macroimages. However, mere determination of the flux of a single image does not provide any information if the intrinsic flux of the source is unknown. The observable quantities, are rather the flux ratio and positions of two separate macroimages of a single source.
While simple, smooth models of galaxy lenses are usually able to reproduce the positions of macroimages (about 1 arcsec apart by definition), their flux ratios are more difficult to explain/reproduce. Such flux ratio violations have been interpreted as evidence of substructure lensing by subhalos within the halo of the main lens. However, this interpretation of flux ratio anomalies being purely due to substructure lensing leads to far too many substructures compared to that expected from CDM simulations. On the other hand, flux ratio anomalies are made by low-mass secondary lenses. Assuming the substructure population predicted by N-body simulations being valid, this discrepancy either comes from secondary lenses along the line of sight at redshifts different from the main lens, or point to the presence of other forms of low-mass dark (or luminous) lenses than low-mass CDM subhalos (we investigate IMBHs and UCMHs in this context in Paper I)

__Time delay__ Each image of a macrolensed source follows a different path to reach the observer, i.e. is subject to a different time delay. This time delay consists of two independent components; the geometrical and the gravitational component. The geometrical component springs from the fact that the path lengths are different for each image. The gravitational component, also known as the Shapiro effect, stems from the relativistic effect of retardation in strong gravitational fields. However, different time delays of various images cannot be observed if the source is not instrinsically variable, since this effect is manifested in the phase difference of the light curves of various images. When it comes ti subhalio hunting, the perturbation to the time delats between macroimages predicted by a smooth lens model serves as an evidence for the presence of substructures within the main lens. As Moustakas+2009 argues, such an effect is only sensitive to subhalos at the high-mass end of the mass function.

__Astrometric shift__ The proximity of the projected image of a foreground massive object to a background source has a couple of effects. Among many, one is a change in the apparent position of the source. This effect which is usually accompanied by magnification or distortion effects is called the astrometric effect. Astrometric effects are therefore detectable mostly in dynamic cases, such as microlensing cases, where the observer can actually follow the differences in the relative positions in the system. One of these cases stems from the presence of substructures in the main lens such that where the deflector consists of a parent halo with a distribution of subhalos inside. When it comes to the astrometric perturbation due to the substructure inside a subhalos, the image gets shifted from the original position of the macroimage, under the influence of a subhalo. Such effect is mostly sensitive to intermediate and high mass substructures Moustakas et al.(2009) and in clearly visible in the results of Paper I. However, we are not interested in GL effects of this kind in our simulations.

__Surface brightness perturbations__ 
Another approach to detecting substructure lensing is small-scale morphology distortions of one of the macroimages of the same light source. Thses surface brightness distortions can be distinguished from the internal source morphology by the characteristic that they are present themselves in one macroimage while source morphology is replicated in all lensed images of the sour. The lensing effects produced by halo substructures can be separated from intrinsic morphological features in jets, since the latter would be reproduced in all macroimages whereas dark matter clumps in the halo of the lens would affect each macroimage differently. Effects of this type tend to be sensitive to the inner density profile (central mass concentration) of the lens substructure. This is the main question we are addressing in Paper II.

### Weighting
Aperture synthesis is the technique of reconstructing an image from incomplete sampling of the Fourier space. The technique is based on modeling the visibility plane based on the existing samplings. Therefore, the more complete the (u, v) coverage the closer the model image to the real one seen by the array. However, there will always be holes in the sampled (u, v) plane limiting the fidelity and quality (i.e. $\text{dynamic range} = \frac{\text{peak}}{\text{RMS}}$ of the reconstructed image.) Fourier transform of the (u, v) coverage gives the so-called _dirty beam_ (equivalent to the point spread function PSF) while the Fourier transform of the measured visibilities on the (u, v) plane results in the ``dirty image'' of the source, which is, as expected, the actual source structure convolved with the dirty beam. Now that we have images of both the beam and the source, we can deconvolve the beam from the image. Remember that deconvolution is non-linear and non-unique! (See \S \ref{sec:CLEAN} to read about the CLEAN algorithm.) In aperture synthesis, modeling is applied while working in the image plane. The process is such that the dirty beam and dirty image are calculated based on the (u, v) coverage and direct visibility measurements, respectively. For this purpose, the (u, v) plane is required to be gridded.

__Natural weighting__ as it sounds is simply weighting visibilities inversely proportional to the variance of their distribution. Therefore, short--spacings in the (u, v) plane, with closer samplings, are weighted more than longer baselines which results in higher dynamic range in the modeled image at the cost of angular resolution. In other words, the dirty beam has larger FWHM but less prominent side lobes (compared to the rms noise). Therefore, it is best for imaging faint and smooth sources. __natural weighting actually increases sidelobe levels, but what it does is reduce the image rms noise.__                      
__Uniform weighting__ is the same as natural weighting with an additional factor inversely proportional to the number of visibilities in each pixel. Therefore, it boosts the contribution from long--spacings by giving the same weight to visibilities at all (u, v) distances, even though those at long distances are sampled more coarsely. This property makes this approach more suitable for sources with rich and complicated structure. Although, the source needs to be bright enough for this approach to work best. This is because this weighting scheme results in a narrow(er than naturally--weighted) PSF with smaller side lobes and therefore, better angular resolution. However, the RMS of the residuals of this model tends are large(r than that of natural by at least an order of $\sim 2$), i.e. poorer sensitivity.

__Briggs weighting__ is a tunable combination of both approaches above. The tunability of Briggs' recipe is applied through the \emph{robust} parameter. This parameter changes in the range of -2 to +2 from uniform to natural weighting. Usually, robust=0.5 gives a good compromise between the two extreme approaches. Although it still depends on the preferences based on the scientific target.

## Paper I (10)
We explored the propsects of using VLBI observations of multiply-lensed quasar jets to detect submilliarcsecond-scale image distortions produced by various forms of halo substructure in the mass range between 10^3 - 10^8 Msun. We ran a series of simulations which examine the detectability of three different dark halo substructures with different VLBI observational modes; The European VLBI network EVN at 22 GHz providing an angular resolution of ~0.3 mas, the global VLBI array at 8.4 GHz resulting in an angular resolution of 0.7 mas, and an upcoming addition of phased ALMA to the global mm VLBI array with an extraordinary resolution of 0.0 5mas at 86 GHz (3mm).
__IMBH__ with mass in 10^3 to 10^6 Msun may either form primordially, when the Universe is << 1s old, or due to baryonic collapse at later times. The non-primordial IMBH may be found as the result of the collapse of very massive pop III stars of globular clusters. The latter of which implies that these blackholes are now either hidden in globular clusters, or could be found in satellite galaxies or free-floating inside galactic halos. hOwever, since only a small fraction of the cosmic baryons can be locked up in these non-primordial IMBHs, their relative contributions to the halo masses of galaxies are typically expected to be small (f IMBH < 10^-5.). When simulating the potential millilensing effects of IMBHs, we treat the surface mass density fraction f IMBH in IMBHs at the position of the macroimages as a free parameter, and for simplicity assume all IMBHs to have the same mass. 
In principle, primordial black holes may over time accrete substantial amounts of dark matter and develop dark matter halos of their own (Mack et al. 2007), similar to the ultracompact minihalos, IMBHs forming through the collapse of pop III stars in minihalos may also be surrounded by their own, highly contracted dark matter halos. Such compound objects are expected to have lensing properties intermediate between IMBHs and ultracompact minihalos, but are not treated in detail in our simulations

Our results show that to detect lensing signatures made by standard dark halo substructures with current and foreseeing VLBI observational modes, we need to focus on large sources, such as radio-loud quasars which are manifested as ∼100-pc sized jets in certain frequency bands. However, if, as some astronomers propose, some fraction of the dark matter is in the form of intermediate-mass black holes with masses ranging from ∼ 10^3 Msun ∼ 10^6 Msun, these observations should be able to confirm it.

## Paper II (10)
The results of Paper I shows that while quasar jets are suitable sources for probing the compact (non-standard) forms of dark matter substructure, more extended sources (~ 10^3 times in area) are needed to study the small-scale lensing perturbations due to the presence of -far less concentrated- standard CDM subhalos. Therefore, the next best target is the dust emission from lensed star-forming galaxies, meaning mm/sub-mm wavelengths. Currently, the highest-resolution observations at this high frequency range can only be done with ALMA. The paper I have been working on focuses on sub-mm galaxies (SMGs) at z ~ 2 which are strongly lensed by a single galaxy at z ~ 0.5. I study the local and overall visibility distortions different images of a same system to derive the mass and density profile of the perturber in the lens and how the degeneracy between the two parameters can change the mass fraction and mass function of dark subhalos from a sample of detections of this kind.
