### Missing satellite problem (3)
The count of satellite galaxies in the local Universe vastly differs from that of subhalos predicted by CDM simulations. Based on the standard structure formation recipe, the smooth component of massive halos are built up from tidal stripping material from smaller ones. However, as this process occurs over several billion years, many small halos are expected to temporarily survive in the form of subhalos which make up $\sim 10\%$ of the mass of a galaxy-sized halo at z=0 \citep[][]{Gao11, Maciejewski11}. On the other hand, dwarf galaxies are expected to form in low-mass field halos, which would result in a large expected number of satellite galaxies within the dark matter halo of the central galaxy. It is commonly argued that this discrepancy could be explained by including feedback processes suppressing star formation in low-mass halos \citep[][]{Maccio10, Font11} meaning that a large population of substructures with very high mass-to-light ratios in the halos of galaxies has remained undiscovered.

### Too big to fail problem (3)
One naively expects to find the most luminous dwarf galaxies in the most massive subhalos and high-resolution cosmological simulations persistently produce massive subhalos ($M_{vir} \geq 10^{10} M_\odot$) which are too concentrated in their central kpc to host any of the satellite galaxies around the Milky Way or Andromeda \citep[][]{Boylan-Kolchin11}. Some models suggest that these satellilee galaxies correspond to more massive subhalos at higher redshifts. Therefore, the discovery of very massive substructures in the halos of galaxies at higher redshifts could help resolving this concern.

## Gravitational lensing (5)
The fact that gravity treats dark and luminous mass the same gives gravitational lensing a unique opportunity to provide an independent test for the presence of halo substructures. Strong lensing by a foreground object can produce multiple images of a background lightsource. Measurements on strong lensing systems provide us with information about mass distribution of both the lens and the source. All different types of massive objects such as galaxies or galaxy clusters can serve as lenses and bend the light from their background. However, in order to study the sub-galactic structure of dark matter we need to look at a particular type of lensing systems which involve a single lens galaxy only. The foreground galaxy produces multiple images of the background light source, which are $\sim1$ arcsec apart. One way to use such systems to probe dark matter on sub-galactic scales is to study the small-scale distortions that halo substructure is expected to introduce in the surface brightness distributions of extended macroimages.
