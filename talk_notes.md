### Missing satellite problem (3)
The count of satellite galaxies in the local Universe vastly differs from that of subhalos predicted by CDM simulations. Based on the standard structure formation recipe, the smooth component of massive halos are built up from tidal stripping material from smaller ones. However, as this process occurs over several billion years, many small halos are expected to temporarily survive in the form of subhalos which make up $\sim 10\%$ of the mass of a galaxy-sized halo at z=0 \citep[][]{Gao11, Maciejewski11}. On the other hand, dwarf galaxies are expected to form in low-mass field halos, which would result in a large expected number of satellite galaxies within the dark matter halo of the central galaxy. It is commonly argued that this discrepancy could be explained by including feedback processes suppressing star formation in low-mass halos \citep[][]{Maccio10, Font11} meaning that a large population of substructures with very high mass-to-light ratios in the halos of galaxies has remained undiscovered.

### Too big to fail problem (3)
One naively expects to find the most luminous dwarf galaxies in the most massive subhalos and high-resolution cosmological simulations persistently produce massive subhalos ($M_{vir} \geq 10^{10} M_\odot$) which are too concentrated in their central kpc to host any of the satellite galaxies around the Milky Way or Andromeda \citep[][]{Boylan-Kolchin11}. Some models suggest that these satellilee galaxies correspond to more massive subhalos at higher redshifts. Therefore, the discovery of very massive substructures in the halos of galaxies at higher redshifts could help resolving this concern.

## Gravitational lensing (5)
The fact that gravity treats dark and luminous mass the same gives gravitational lensing a unique opportunity to provide an independent test for the presence of halo substructures. Strong lensing by a foreground object can produce multiple images of a background lightsource. Measurements on strong lensing systems provide us with information about mass distribution of both the lens and the source. All different types of massive objects such as galaxies or galaxy clusters can serve as lenses and bend the light from their background. However, in order to study the sub-galactic structure of dark matter we need to look at a particular type of lensing systems which involve a single lens galaxy only. The foreground galaxy produces multiple images of the background light source, which are $\sim1$ arcsec apart. One way to use such systems to probe dark matter on sub-galactic scales is to study the small-scale distortions that halo substructure is expected to introduce in the surface brightness distributions of extended macroimages.

### Flux-ratio anomaly/Time delay-Astrometric shift/Surface-brightness disturbance/
__Flux ratio anomalies__ Gravitational lensing is a propagation phenomenon, thus it _in principle_  conserves the number of photons. On the other hand, the gravitational deflection influences the cross section of the light bundle differentially. Consequently, in order to conserve the flux, the area of the image(s) of the source changes. This leads to different magnifications for different macroimages. However, mere determination of the flux of a single image does not provide any information if the intrinsic flux of the source is unknown. The observable quantities, are rather the flux ratio and positions of two separate macroimages of a single source.

__Time delay__ Each image of a macrolensed source follows a different path to reach the observer, i.e. is subject to a different time delay. This time delay consists of two independent components; the geometrical and the gravitational component. The geometrical component springs from the fact that the path lengths are different for each image. The gravitational component, also known as the Shapiro effect, stems from the relativistic effect of retardation in strong gravitational fields. However, different time delays of various images cannot be observed if the source is not instrinsically variable, since this effect is manifested in the phase difference of the light curves of various images. When it comes ti subhalio hunting, the perturbation to the time delats between macroimages predicted by a smooth lens model serves as an evidence for the presence of substructures within the main lens. As Moustakas+2009 argues, such an effect is only sensitive to subhalos at the high-mass end of the mass function.

__Astrometric shift__ The proximity of the projected image of a foreground massive object to a background source has a couple of effects. Among many, one is a change in the apparent position of the source. This effect which is usually accompanied by magnification or distortion effects is called the astrometric effect. Astrometric effects are therefore detectable mostly in dynamic cases, such as microlensing cases, where the observer can actually follow the differences in the relative positions in the system. One of these cases stems from the presence of substructures in the main lens such that where the deflector consists of a parent halo with a distribution of subhalos inside. When it comes to the astrometric perturbation due to the substructure inside a subhalos, the image gets shifted from the original position of the macroimage, under the influence of a subhalo. Such effect is mostly sensitive to intermediate and high mass substructures Moustakas et al.(2009) and in clearly visible in the results of Paper I. However, we are not interested in GL effects of this kind in our simulations.

## Paper I (10)
we run a series of simulations which examine the detectability of three different dark halo substructures with different VLBI observational modes. Our results show that to detect lensing signatures made by standard dark halo substructures with current and foreseeing VLBI observational modes, we need to focus on large sources, such as radio-loud quasars which are manifested as ∼100-pc sized jets in certain frequency bands. However, if, as some astronomers propose, some fraction of the dark matter is in the form of intermediate-mass black holes with masses ranging from ∼ 10^3 M_sun ∼ 10^6 M_sun, these observations should be able to confirm it.

## Paper II (10)
The results of Paper I shows that while quasar jets are suitable sources for probing the compact (non-standard) forms of dark matter substructure, more extended sources (~ 10^3 times in area) are needed to study the small-scale lensing perturbations due to the presence of -far less concentrated- standard CDM subhalos. Therefore, the next best target is the dust emission from lensed star-forming galaxies, meaning mm/sub-mm wavelengths. Currently, the highest-resolution observations at this high frequency range can only be done with ALMA. The paper I have been working on focuses on sub-mm galaxies (SMGs) at z ~ 2 which are strongly lensed by a single galaxy at z ~ 0.5. I study the local and overall visibility distortions different images of a same system to derive the mass and density profile of the perturber in the lens and how the degeneracy between the two parameters can change the mass fraction and mass function of dark subhalos from a sample of detections of this kind.
